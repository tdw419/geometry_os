# Neural Heatmap Phase 2 1 4 Correlation Analytics

## Summary

Implement advanced correlation analytics including cross-layer analysis, temporal pattern detection, and anomaly identification for multi-model neural activity comparison.

## Motivation

This change implements the architecture described below, enabling spec-driven development
and verification of the implementation.

## Architecture

Extend the existing MultiModelTracker and ComparativeHeatmap with correlation matrix computation, temporal activity tracking, and statistical anomaly detection.

## Tech Stack

PIXI.js v8, WebGPU/WGSL shaders, JavaScript ES6+, Web Workers for parallel computation
