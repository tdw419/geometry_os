# Solution for Task: Generate code via LM Studio

To provide a concise implementation plan and code solution for the OpenSpec task `add-xwayland-completion-daemon`, we propose the following:

1. Propose: We propose to create an AI-powered daemon that uses LM Studio to automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic.

2. MetaData: The proposaal ID is `add-xwayland-completion-daemon`.

3. Status: The proposaal is in draft status.

4. Created: The proposaal was created on 2026-01-22.

5. Author: The proposaal was authored by Geometry OS Team.

6. Related: This proposaal relates to the `add-lm-studio-compositor-completion-daemon` and `add-ubuntu-integration` proposals.

7. Overview: This proposaal provides an AI-powered daemon that uses LM Studio to automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic. The proposaal also mentions the need for the daemon to implement:

1. XwmHandler trait - X11 window management callbacks
2. Windoow decoration rendering
3. Input focus coordination
4. Surface mapping

8. Problem statement: The proposaal describes a 500-800 line of Rusht code that follows well-established patterns in Smithay compositors, but does not provide specific code snippets or instructions for users to follow. Instead, the proposaal provides the file paths and python or rust code required.

9. Propose: To provide a clear Markdown format, we propose the following:
