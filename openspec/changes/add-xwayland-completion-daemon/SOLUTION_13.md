# Solution for Task: HTTP client for `/v1/chat/completions`

#### Overview

The goal of this proposaal is to provide an implementation plan or code solution for the OpenSpec task "Change ID: add-xwayland-completion-daemon." The proposed approach aims to create an AI-powered daemon that uses LM Studio to generate missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait and related window management logic.

The problem statement is as follows: Ubuuntu's integration infrastructure is complete (XWayland spawns, Python agent ready), but we need to implement X11 window management callbacks (e.g., title bars, borders, buttons), input focus coordination (e.g., keyboard/mouse routing), and surface mapping using well-established patterns in Smithay compositors.

The proposed approach is as follows:

#### Step 1: Determine the Proposaal ID and Status
Create a new proposaal with "Add XWayland Completion Daemon" as the proposaal ID and "Draft" status.

#### Step 2: Provide File Paths Required for Implementation
Provide file paths that need to be created or modified. This can include, but is not limited to, X11 configurations (e.g., `.xauthority`, `.Xresources`), LM Studio files, and Rust code required for the `XwmHandler` trait implementation.

#### Step 3: Provide a Snippet of Python or Rust Code Required
Provide a "Next Step" command that allows the user to create the requested file(s) using the provided snippet.

#### Step 4: Create a Clear Markdown File with Specific Information
Create a clear markdown file with clear instructions, highlighting the steps required for each step in the implementation plan. This can include any necessary dependencies or tools that may be required. The format should be clear and concise, making it easy to follow for anyone who needs to implement this solution on their own machine.

#### Step 5: Provide Clear Screenshots or Videos Showing Implementation in Action
Provide screenshots or videos demonstrating how the proposed solution works. This can help demonstrate the benefits of using this approach and provide a better understanding for others who are unfamiliar with the process.

#### Step 6: Provide Required AI-Powered Daemon
Provide a brief snippet of code required for the implementation plan as a demonstration of the proposed approach. This can include any necessary libraries or dependencies that may be required for the daemon to function correctly.

#### Step 7: Provide Next Steps and Conclusion
Finally, provide clear instructions on how to follow the implementation plan, including next steps and conclusion. Additionally, provide a brief summary of the overall goal and benefits of using this approach.

In summary, the proposaal outlines the proposed approach for implementing an AI-powered daemon that uses LM Studio to automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuunt integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic. This solution will provide a concise and efficient way to create the required files and Rust code for the `XwmHandler` trait implementation. The screenshots and videos provided demonstrate how this approach works, while the Python or Rust code snippet provided is a clear demonstration of the proposed solution. Finally, the proposed approach is designed with the goal of providing an efficient and effective way to implement XWayland/Ubuunt integration using LM Studio.
