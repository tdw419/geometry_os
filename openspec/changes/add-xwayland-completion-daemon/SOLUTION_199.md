# Solution for Task: Clippy warnings count

Table of Contents
1. Context:
    - Change ID: add-xwayland-completion-daemon
    - Task: Clippy warnings count
2. Proposaal: XWayland Completion Daemon
3. Overview
    - Create an AI-powered daemon that uses LM Studio to automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic
4. Problem Statement
    - The Ubuuntu integration infrastructure is complete (XWayland spawns, Python agent ready), but we need to implement:
        - XwmHandler trait
        - Window decoration rendering
        - Input focus coordination
        - Surface mapping
5. Problem Statement (revised)
    - The Ubuuntu integration infrastructure is complete (XWayland spawns, Python agent ready), but we need to implement:
        - XwmHandler trait
        - Window decoration rendering
        - Input focus coordinator
        - Surface mapping

9. Planning (revised)
    - Create a file path that needs to be created or modified (e.g. `path/to/file1`, `path/to/file2`)
    - A brief snippet of the Python code required, including how it will interact with LM Studio and the `XwmHandler` trait
    - The 'Next Step' command for the user (e.g. Create a file, run a script)
