# Solution for Task: Drag to move

[PROPOSED PLAN]

Context:
Add a XWayland Completion Daemon to improve the integration of Geometry OS with Linux-based operating systems like Ubuntu. The daemon should be designed using LM Studio, allowing for auto-generation of missing integration code and related window management logic. The solution should meet high standards for functionality, ease of use, and compatibility with other Geometry OS features.

Proposed Solution:
1. Create an AI-powered daemon that uses the XWayland/Ubuntu integration infrastructure to generate missing XWayland/Ubuxt integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic.
2. Implement this system using LM Studio, ensuring the code is well-established, maintainable, and follows best practices in compositor development.
3. Provide clear steps for users to follow to create and modify file paths and generate the required python/rust code.
4. Test the system thoroughly to ensure it works as expected with the given input/output requirements.
5. Document the solution to ensure its future scalability and maintainability.
6. Integrate the solution into the Geometry OS software stack, including integration with other tools such as LM Studio or XWayland.
7. Continuously monitor and maintain the system to ensure its quality, security, and compatibility with future updates to the operating system.

Comparison to Existing Solutions:
1. The proposed solution provides a comprehensive solution for Geometry OS integration with XWayland/Ubuxt.
2. The system is built using LM Studio, an open-source compositor development framework that is commonly used in the Linux community.
3. The system follows best practices in compositor development and meets high standards for functionality, ease of use, and compatibility with other Geometry OS features.
4. The proposed solution has a clear workflow for users to follow, which makes it easy to use and integrate into existing Geometry OS workflows.
5. The solution is scalable and future-proof, allowing it to grow with the changing needs of Geometry OS development.

Implementation:
1. Create a new repository for the proposed solution on GitHub or GitLab.
2. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Travis CI, Circle CI, or Jenkins. This will ensure that the code is continuously tested and updated with new releases.
3. Develop the system using Python or Rust programming languages, depending on the project's requirements.
4. Use LM Studio to generate the missing integration code and window management logic.
5. Document the solution in clear and concise steps, including code snippets where applicable.
6. Test the system thoroughly to ensure it works as expected with the given input/output requirements.
7. Integrate the proposed solution into the Geometry OS software stack, including integration with other tools such as LM Studio or XWayland.
8. Continuously monitor and maintain the system to ensure its quality, security, and compatibility with future updates to the operating system.
9. Document the solution to ensure its future scalability and maintainability.
10. Provide regular updates and bug fixes as needed to maintain the solution's quality and stability over time.
