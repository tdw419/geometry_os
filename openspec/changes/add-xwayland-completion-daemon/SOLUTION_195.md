# Solution for Task: Track runtime test success rate

Introduction:
The Geometry OS team has a goal of providing a concise implementation plan or code solution for the following OpenSpec task, namely the XWayland Completion Daemon (XWAYLND). The objective is to add an AI-powered daemon that uses LM Studio to automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic.

Context:
The current Geometry OS system uses X11 for window management and provides a well-established compositor API (Smithay) for compositing UI elements. However, there is still a gap in the integration between XWayland and Ubuntu, as mentioned earlier. The XWAYLND daemon will help fill this gap by automatically generating missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code for various window management tasks using LM Studio.

Problem Statement:
The system currently lacks a comprehensive and efficient way to handle the integration of XWayland with Ubuntu, which is why we need an AI-powered daemon that can generate missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code automatically. This will improve the overall performance, reliability, and maintainability of Geometry OS.

Solution:
The solution proposed in this proposaal is to create an AI-powered daemon using LM Studio that generates missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic. The daemon will use Smithay compositors for compositing UI elements.

Steps:
1. Define the task requirements: The proposaal identifies the problem statement, the objective, and the context. It also defines the problem statement.
2. Plan the implementation of the daemon: This includes defining the file paths required for the daemon's creation or modification, a brief code snippet for the Python or Rust implementation, and a next step command for the user.
3. Test the daemon: The proposaal identifies the testing steps to be performed on the daemon. It defines the test cases that will be executed, the expected results, and the methodology to perform the tests.
4. Deploy and maintain the daemon: This section outlines the deployment and maintenance process of the daemon. The proposaal provides details about how the daemon will be deployed on the Geometry OS system, its accessibility, and any necessary updates or patches.

Conclusion:
The proposed XWAYLND daemon using LM Studio is a comprehensive solution that fills a gap in the integration of XWayland with Ubuntu. The proposaal outlines the steps to be taken to implement the daemon, including file paths for creating or modifying code snippets and testing the daemon. This proposaal also provides deployment details and maintenance information.
