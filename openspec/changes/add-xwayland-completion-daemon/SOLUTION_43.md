Proposa: XWayland Completion Daemon

Introduction
- The Geometry OS team is tasked with improving the Wayland integration for Geometry OS systems, which includes creating an AI-powered daemon that uses LM Studio to automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code.

Overview
The Geometry OS team is tasked with improving the Wayland integration for Geometry OS systems. One of the main issues is that there's currently no AI-powered daemon that can automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic. In order to address this issue, we propose creating an AI-powered daemon that uses LM Studio to automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuintu integration code.

Problem Statement
The Geometry OS team needs to implement:
1. An AI-powered XWayland/Ubuntu integration daemon that uses LM Studio to automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubutu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic.
2. Windower decoration rendering, title bars, borders, buttons, input focus coordination, and surface mapping using X11 surfaces → Wayland surfaces → Window particles.

Proposed Approach and Metadata
We propose the following approach for creating an AI-powered XWayland/Ubuntu integration daemon:
1. Create a file path that needs to be created or modified.
2. Provide a brief snippet of Python or Rust code required for generating the above code.
3. Provide a "Next Step" command for the user (e.g. Create a file, run a script).

Format as clear Markdown.
