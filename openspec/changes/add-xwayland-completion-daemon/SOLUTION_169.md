# Solution for Task: **Daemon documentation**

Title: Geometry OS XWayland Completion Daemon

Introduction:

The Geometry OS team is responsible for implementing the X11 window management callbacks, Window decorations, and input focus coordination in the XWayland/Ubuuntu integration infrastructure. Our goal is to provide a concise solution that automates the generation of missing code for these areas while adhering to established patterns in Smithay compositors.

Task Description:

This task entails creating an AI-powered daemon that uses LM Studio to automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuuntu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic. This will require creating a Python or Rust script that can access the necessary file paths and generate the required code.

Tasks:

- Create a Python or Rust script for the X11 window management callbacks.
- Generate the necessary Python or Rust files for Window decoration rendering, Title bars, borders, buttons, and input focus coordination using Smithay compositors.
- Create a Markdown file that provides clear instructions to the user on how to create the required files.
- Test the script and ensure it generates the necessary code according to established patterns in Smithay compositors.

Steps:

1. Configure a Python or Rust environment with Smithay compositor libraries (e.g. PySM, Rsmiley, and Smike).
2. Create a Python or Rust script that generates the necessary code for window management callbacks (XwmHandler) and related Window decoration rendering logic (Title bars, borders, buttons, and input focus coordination).
3. Write clear instructions in Markdown format for creating the required files using the script.
4. Test the script to ensure it generates the correct code according to established patterns in Smithay compositors.
5. Create a GitHub repository with the generated code and instructions.
6. Release the Geometry OS XWayland Completion Daemon as an open-source project on GitHub.
7. Provide a brief mention of the Python or Rust script, Markdown file, and GitHub repository in the official announcement for the integration infrastructure update.
