Overview
Create an AI-powered daemon that uses the XWayland/Ubuntu integration infrastructure to automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic. The daemon should be able to handle input focus coordination, surface mapping, and keyboard/mouse routing.

Problem Statement
The Ubuuntu integration infrastructure is complete (XWayland spawns, Python agent ready), but we need to implement the following missing code:

1. XwmHandler trait implementation and related window management logic
2. Title bars, borders, buttons
3. Input focus coordination
4. Surface mapping

Planning Steps
1. Create file paths that need to be created or modified for the Python/Rust code required.
2. Create a brief snippet of the Python/Rust code required.
3. Create a Next Step command for the user.

Implementation Steps
- [Create file paths...]
- [Create Python/Rust code required...]
- [Brief snippet of Python/Rust code required...]
- [Next Step command for the user...]

Testing Steps
1. Test the Python/Rust code to make sure it is working properly.
2. Test the file paths that need to be created or modified.
3. Test the Next Step command for the user.

Conclusion
This proposaal provides a comprehensive plan for implementing a complete XWayland/Ubuintu integration infrastructure using Python and Rust. The daemon will handle input focus coordination, surface mapping, and keyboard/mouse routing. It is expected that this daemon can be completed in the next few months, after which it will be tested thoroughly to ensure its effectiveness for the Geometry OS community.
