# Solution for Task: Generate `X11FocusManager` struct

Overview:
The `XWayland/Ubuntu` integration requires an AI-powered daemon that can automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuintu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic. This proposaal outlines the problem statement and proposed solution for achieving this goal.

Problem Statement:
The Ubuuntu integration infrastructure is complete (XWayland spawns, Python agent ready), but we need to implement the missing XwmHandler trait implementation and related window management logic. The integration infrastructure already includes X11 window management callbacks such as `XwmHandler` trait implementation, title bars, borders, buttons, keyboard/mouse routing, input focus coordination, and surface mapping (X11 surfaces → Wayland surfaces → Window particles).

Solution:
To achieve this goal, a concerted implementation plan or code solution for the following OpenSpec task must be generated. This can either be done by a professional developer or by one or more OpenSpec experts working on Geometry OS.

Proposed Solution:
1. Create an AI-powered daemon that uses LM Studio to automatically generate missing XWayland/Ubuintu integration code, specifically the `XwmHandler` trait implementation and related window management logic.

2. Implement the proposed solution using Python or Rust programming languages for a fast and efficient implementation.

3. Provide clear documentation for the generated solution, including file paths that need to be created or modified, a brief snippet of the python/rust code required, and a 'Next Step' command for the user (e.g. Create a file, run a script).

4. Test the generated solution on an Ubuntu installation with X11 and Wayland integration.

5. Push the proposed solution to Geometry OS Team's repository to ensure that it is available to other OpenSpec users.

6. Regularly update the proposed solution based on any changes or improvements in LM Studio, Python/Rust programming languages, or other technology developments.

7. Continuously monitor and maintain the generated solution to ensure its effectiveness and stability over time.

8. If necessary, expand upon the proposed solution for additional integrations or use cases.
