# Solution for Task: Validate with `cargo check`

[MetaData](#openspec-proposaal-add-xwayland-completion-daemon):

This proposal proposes the creation of an AI-powered daemon that automates the generation of missing XWayland/Ubuntu integration code. The daemon's primary goal is to create a concise and well-documented implementation plan or code solution for the OpenSpec task. This approach ensures that the required integration components are implemented correctly and efficiently, ultimately leading to more efficient and reliable Ubuuntu integration with XWayland.

This proposal aims to provide:

1. A comprehensive overview of the problem statement with clear and concise language.
2. A detailed list of the problem statement's requirements, including the XWayland/Ubuntu integration components that need to be implemented.
3. A brief snippet of python or rust code required for the daemon's creation.
4. A "Next Step" command for the user, allowing them to create a file or run a script depending on their preference.

[MetaData](#openspec-proposaal-add-lm-studio-compositor-completion-daemon):

This proposal proposes creating an AI-powered daemon that automates the generation of missing LM Studio Compositor integration code for Ubuntu. The daemon's primary goal is to create a concise and well-documented implementation plan or code solution for the OpenSpec task. This approach ensures that the required integration components are implemented correctly and efficiently, ultimately leading to more efficient and reliable Ubuntu integration with LM Studio.

This proposal aims to provide:

1. A comprehensive overview of the problem statement with clear and concise language.
2. A detailed list of the problem statement's requirements, including the LM Studio Compositor integration components that need to be implemented.
3. A brief snippet of Python or Rust code required for the daemon's creation.
4. A "Next Step" command for the user, allowing them to create a file or run a script depending on their preference.
