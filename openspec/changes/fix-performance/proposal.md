# Proposal: fix-performance

[Proposal for Area: Performance]

Area: Performance
Description: Implement a new performance optimization for the visual shell core (VSC) of Geometry OS to enhance its overall performance and scalability.

Priorities: High
Affected Components: Add-Neural-Perception-Kernel-for-Holodeck

Problem Statement:
The VSC is the core component responsible for rendering the visual shells in Geometry OS, which is an important aspect of the platform's functionality. The performance of the VSC can have a significant impact on the overall user experience, particularly when multiple users are attempting to interact with the system simultaneously. As such, improving its performance is essential for optimizing the platform's capabilities and ensuring that it meets the needs of its users.

Proposed Solution:
The proposed solution for this gap is to implement a new performance optimization for the VSC. Specifically, we will be using an add-neural-perception-kernel (ANPK) as a performance booster. ANPK is a neural network model designed to improve the visual performance of computers by enhancing their processing speed and memory capacity.

Benefits:
The proposed solution has several benefits, including:
1. Improved Performance: The addition of ANNPK will significantly enhance the VSC's performance, which will have a positive impact on the platform's overall user experience. This will enable users to interact with the system at greater speeds, reducing the need for frequent restarts or delays in response time.
2. Scalability: The new performance booster will also increase the VSC's scalability by allowing it to handle more users simultaneously. This will ensure that the platform can cater to a wider user base while still maintaining high levels of performance and reliability.
3. Cost-effective: Implementing a performance optimization like ANNPK is an affordable solution, as it does not require significant hardware investment or upgrades. This will make Geometry OS more cost-effective in the long run while still meeting its users' needs for faster and more efficient performance.
4. Reduced Energy Consumption: The ANNPK will also help reduce energy consumption, which is critical in today's increasingly sustainable computing environment. This will help Geometry OS to meet its environmental goals while still delivering high levels of performance.

Risks:
While the proposed solution has several benefits, there are also some risks associated with implementing it. These include:
1. Performance Dependence on Specific Hardware: The proposed solution relies on specific hardware and software configurations that may not be suitable for all users or platforms. This will require careful planning and testing to ensure that the solution works efficiently across a range of configurations.
2. Longer Development Time: Implementing this solution will require more time than usual, which may increase project costs. This additional time may also affect the timeline for delivering features and improving performance.
3. Compatibility Issues: As with any hardware or software upgrade, compatibility issues can arise. These could impact users' ability to use the platform or cause bugs or errors in their applications.

Timeline Estimate:
We estimate that implementing this solution will take approximately six months from start to finish, including testing and debugging. We plan to conduct a pilot test with a small group of users to ensure that the proposed performance optimization is effective before rolling it out to all users.

In conclusion, this proposal seeks to implement an add-neural-perception-kernel (ANPK) performance optimization for the visual shell core (VSC) of Geometry OS. This solution will significantly improve VSC performance and scalability, enabling increased user experience while maintaining high levels of reliability and energy efficiency. By reducing energy consumption, we aim to meet our environmental goals, making Geometry OS more cost-effective in the long run. We plan to conduct thorough testing and debugging to ensure that this solution is effective before rolling it out to all users.
