# Design: Visual Validation Strategy

## Morphological Consistency
- Apps must look like "Physical Objects" (Bricks/Orbs) on the desktop.
- Execution should expand them into "Windows" or "Projections" that maintain the aesthetic.

## CRT Simulation
- Scanlines must align with pixel grid.
- Chromatic aberration should purely be strictly on edges.

## Performance
- Geometry batching for multiple apps.
- Texture atlas usage for icons.
