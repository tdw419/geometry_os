# Proposal: fix-memory-leaks

# Area: Performance

## Description

In this proposal, we will focus on the gap between the visual shell kernel and the add-neural-perception-kernel-for-holodeck (ANP) performance in a real-world scenario. This gap has been identified as a significant bottleneck in the overall system, resulting in poor user experience and limited functionality.

## Priority

This proposal is of high priority due to its potential impact on the success of the project and the user experience. A successful implementation will provide a significant improvement in performance and usability for all users.

## Affected Components

Add-Neural Perception Kernel (ANP) is the core technology that powers the Holodeck system, which provides immersive experiences through virtual reality (VR). This technology requires high performance to achieve realistic visual results, as well as accurate and fast processing capabilities.

## Problem Statement

The main issue with ANP's performance is a lack of support for complex tasks that require advanced computational power. These tasks can range from rendering highly detailed 3D models or large datasets to processing large amounts of information quickly. In these cases, the system can become slow and unresponsive, leading to frustrating user experiences.

## Proposed Solution

To address this issue, we propose a new version of ANP that incorporates additional hardware components and software solutions. The proposed solution includes:

- Addition of a dedicated GPU for rendering high-performance 3D models and other complex tasks.
- Implementation of parallel processing capabilities to process large datasets faster.
- Upgrade of the operating system's memory management technology to improve performance.

The new ANP version will be designed with the following benefits:

- Faster rendering, resulting in smoother visual experiences.
- Improved processing capabilities, leading to better overall performance and usability.
- Reduced system stress and improved energy efficiency.

We expect that this solution will provide a significant improvement in ANP's performance, reducing the impact on users' experience.

## Benefits

The following are the benefits of implementing this proposal:

1. Improved overall performance and usability for all users.
2. Increased energy efficiency, resulting in reduced operating costs over time.
3. Better processing capabilities, leading to higher-quality visual experiences.
4. Reduced system stress, improving the reliability and maintainability of the system.
5. Improved user experience, leading to increased satisfaction with Holodeck's offering.

## Risks

The following are potential risks that could arise as a result of implementing this proposal:

1. System stability and reliability issues.
2. Technical difficulties with the new hardware components and software solutions.
3. Unexpected performance issues with complex tasks, leading to reduced user satisfaction.

We plan to mitigate these risks by conducting thorough testing and quality assurance measures. We also have a strong support network in place to address any issues that may arise during implementation.
