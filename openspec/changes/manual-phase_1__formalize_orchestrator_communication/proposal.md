# Change: manual-phase_1__formalize_orchestrator_communication

## Problem Statement
A detailed plan for implementing the roadmap phase: Phase 1: Formalize Orchestrator Communication. This was generated by the fallback mechanism.

## Proposed Solution
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 1: Formalize Orchestrator Communication due to an AI decomposition failure.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Medium complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (automated implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- **Goal**: Phase 1: Formalize Orchestrator Communication

**Description**: Create a new directory: `systems/roadmap/mcp_sdk`. Create a client file: `systems/roadmap/mcp_sdk/client.py`. Modify `systems/roadmap/mcp_bridge.py` to import and instantiate the `MCPClient`. Update the `test_mcp_bridge_integration` test in `systems/roadmap/test_basic.py` to verify that the mock server receives the correct JSON payload via the new SDK.

**Key Deliverables**:
- **Objective 1: Create a Local MCP SDK**
- **Goal:** Develop a simple, internal SDK to handle communication with the MCP Orchestrator, replacing the placeholder logic in the bridge.
- **Tasks:**
- In `client.py`, define an `MCPClient` class with methods for connecting and submitting tasks via HTTP POST requests. This client should handle basic error cases like connection failures.
- **Objective 2: Integrate SDK into MCP Bridge**
- **Goal:** Refactor the `MCPBridge` to use the new `MCPClient`.
- **Tasks:**
- The `dispatch_change` method in the bridge will now call the SDK's client to send each task.
- **Objective 3: Update Integration Tests**
- **Goal:** Modify the test suite to ensure the SDK works correctly with the `MockMCPServer`.
- **Tasks:**
- Update `systems/roadmap/mock_mcp_server.py` to expect a simple JSON payload for tasks.
