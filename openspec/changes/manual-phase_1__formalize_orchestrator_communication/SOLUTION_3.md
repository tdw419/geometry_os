# Solution for Task: **Task 1**: **Goal**: Phase 1: Formalize Orchestrator Communication

Title: Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 1: Formalize Orchestrator Communication due to an AI decomposition failure

Goal: To implement the roadmap phase: Phase 1: Formalize Orchestrator Communication, which was generated by the fallback mechanism.

Problem Statement: The proposed solution aims to create a new directory and client file in `systems/roadmap/mcp_sdk` for implementing Phase 1: Formalize Orchestrator Communication due to an AI decomposition failure. The implementation will verify that the mock server receives correct JSON payload via the new SDK.

Impact Assessment: Medium complexity, moderate risk (automated implementation), medium dependencies.

Success Criteria: Goal 1: Create a Local MCP SDK.

Design: A detailed plan for implementing Phase 1: Formalize Orchestrator Communication using the roadmap requirements as design constraints. The compoment details will be discussed in the following sections.

Architectural Overview: The proposed solution is to implement the Phase 1: Formalize Orchestrator Communication using the `MCPClient` class from the MCP SDK, which can be found at the root of the systems/roadmap directory.

Compomponent Details:

1. Create a new directory called `systems/roadmap/mcp_sdk`.
2. Modify `systems/roadmap/mcp_bridge.py` to import and instantiate the `MCPClient`.
3. Update the `test_mcp_bridge_integration` test in `systems/roadmap/test_basic.py` to verify that the mock server receives the correct JSON payload via the new SDK.

Design:

1. Define a new client file called `client.py`, with the following import statement:
    ```python
    from mcp_sdk.mcpclient import MCPClient
    ```

2. Create a new class called `MCPClient` in `systems/roadmap/mcp_sdk`:
   - A `__init__` method to create an instance of the client.
   - A `send_request` method to send a request and receive a response.

3. Create a new directory called `systems/roadmap`.
4. Copy `test_mcp_bridge_integration` and rename it as `test_mcp_client_integration`.
5. Modify the test file to use the new client:
   - Replace the import statement with the one from step 1.
   - Replace the `MCPClient` class in the test file with the one created in step 2.
   - Add a new method called `test_send_request_integration` that checks if the mock server receives the correct JSON payload via the new SDK.

Design:

1. Implement the client class, including the `__init__`, `send_request`, and `test_send_request_integration` methods.
2. Write unit tests for each method using `unittest`.
3. Add a test file called `test_mcp_client_integration.py` that includes both the `MCPClient` class and unit tests.
4. Write integration tests using mocked APIs or other tools, as necessary.
5. Verify the implementation with an end-to-end testing framework, such as Selenium or Protractor.
