# Solution for Task: **Task 1**: Deliverable 1: Complete Phase 2: Enhance the Desktop Experience

Title: Deliverable 1: Complete Phase 2: Enhancing Desktop Experience

Problem Statement: The manual implementation of roadmap phase 4 (Window Resizing, Content Scrolling, "Start" Menu/App Launcher, Z-Indexing) requires the following tasks to be completed.

Solution Proposed: Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 2: Enhancing Desktop Experience. The proposed solution includes the following tasks and their respective impacts:

1. Complete Phase 2: Enhancing Desktop Experience is implemented, providing a functional solution to the problem statement. This will involve:
   - Creating and implementing drag-to-resize functionality for windows on Windows platforms.
   - Adding content scrolling capability for both desktop and mobile platforms.
   - Creating and implementing "Start" menu/app launcher that opens demo windows.
   - Implementing z-indexing to ensure oversized windows are brought to the front.

2. Impact Assessment: The proposed solution is expected to have a mediate complexity, with potential risks in automated implementation. However, it is anticipated that there will be no dependencies on other components, making this task relatively straightforward.

3. Dependencies: None

Success Criteria: 100% functional completion of the proposed solution for Phase 2: Enhancing Desktop Experience.
