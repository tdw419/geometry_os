# Proposal: Add Learning & Integration System

## Why
To enable Geometry OS to continuously learn from user interactions, environmental feedback, and system performance, fostering proactive assistance and true personalization. This aligns with Phase 25 goals of advanced intelligence and self-optimization.

## What
This proposal outlines the integration of learning mechanisms with the recently completed Core Memory System. It will encompass:
- Feedback loop integration for continuous model refinement.
- Personalization engine based on learned user preferences and behavior.
- A/B testing framework for evaluating new learning algorithms.
- System integrations to apply learned insights across various Geometry OS modules.
- Development of an end-to-end demo to showcase learning capabilities.
- Comprehensive documentation for the new system.

## Impact
This change will significantly enhance the intelligence and adaptability of Geometry OS. It will move the system closer to a truly self-optimizing and user-centric experience, allowing for dynamic adjustments and more intuitive interactions. The Core Memory System will serve as the foundation for storing and retrieving learned patterns.
