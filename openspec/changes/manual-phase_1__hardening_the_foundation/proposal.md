# Change: manual-phase_1__hardening_the_foundation

## Problem Statement
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: This initial phase focuses on ensuring the robustness of the self-improvement mechanisms themselves. We must guarantee that the system can recover from errors during its own modification process.

## Proposed Solution
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 1: Hardening the Foundation

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Medium complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (automated implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- **Goal**: Phase 1: Hardening the Foundation

**Description**: This initial phase focuses on ensuring the robustness of the self-improvement mechanisms themselves. We must guarantee that the system can recover from errors during its own modification process.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Implement `JSONRepair` shared utility for robust LLM communication (Completed)
- Integrate `JSONRepair` into `ImplementationAgent` (Completed)
- Integrate `JSONRepair` into `ChangeGenerator` for robust roadmap processing (Completed)
- Create strict verification tests for the repair mechanism (Completed)
- Establish CTRM logging for repair success rates
