# Solution for Task: **Task 1**: **Goal**: Phase 1: Hardening the Foundation

Title: Direct Implementation of Roadmap Phase: Hardening the Foundation

--- Proposaal ---
# Change: manual-phase_1__hardening_the_foundation

## Problem Statement
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: This initial phase focuses on ensuring the robustness of the self-improvement mechanisms themselves. We must guarantee that the system can recover from errors during its own modification process.

## Proposed Solution
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 1: Hardening the Foundation

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Medium complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (Automated Implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- **Goal**: Phase 1: Hardening the Foundation

**Descripion**: This initial phase focuses on ensuring the robustness of the self-improvement mechanisms themselves. We must guarantee that the system can recover from errors during its own modification process.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Implement `JSONRepair` shared utility for robust LLM communication (Completed)
- Integrate `JSONRepair` into `ImplementationAgent` (Completed)
- Integrate `JSONRepair` into `ChangeGenerator` (Completed)

        Pleaase provide:
        1. file paths that need to be created or modified.
        2. A brief snippet of the python or rust code required.
        3. A 'Next Step' command for the user (e.g. create a file, run a script).
