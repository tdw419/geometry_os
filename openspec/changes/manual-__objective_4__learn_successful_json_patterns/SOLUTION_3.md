Design:
1. Direct Implementation of Roadmap Requirements

Architecture Overview:
Manual implementation: # Objective 4: Learn Successful JSON Patterns

Competencies:
1. Manually store and retrieve successful JSON patterns using Python functions.
2. Incorporate examples of valid JSON structures into prompts for future use in automated testing.

Design Plan:
1. Direct Implementation of Roadmap Requirements

Competencies:
1. Develop and implement Python code to store and retrieve successful JSON patterns.
2. Use the `get_closest_truths()` function to retrieve proven patterns from previous automated testing.
3. Incorporate examples of valid JSON structures into prompts for future use in automated testing.

Design Steps:
1. Develop a Python code base to store and retrieve successful JSON patterns based on the requirements specified in the roadmap.
2. Implement `get_closest_truths()` function to retrieve proven patterns from previous automated testing.
3. Incorporate examples of valid JSON structures into prompts for future use in automated testing.
4. Test and validate that the code meets all requirements specified in the roadmap.
5. Document the code base and procedures.
6. Provide a brief overview to the user for each task completed.
7. Update the roadmap as needed to ensure continued progress towards achieving the goal.
