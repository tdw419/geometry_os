# Tasks: manual-__objective_4__learn_successful_json_patterns

- [x] **Task 1**: **Goal**: # Objective 4: Learn Successful JSON Patterns

**Description**: 1. **When a plan succeeds without repair:** Store the prompt pattern as a "truth" with high confidence 2. **When repair is needed and succeeds:** Store the original prompt with lower confidence Store the repair prompt that worked with higher confidence 3. **Inject proven patterns into future prompts:** Use `get_closest_truths()` to retrieve successful patterns Include examples of valid JSON structures in the prompt

**Key Deliverables**:
- *Goal:** Use the Truth Engine to encode proven JSON generation patterns.
- *Tasks:**
- Truth format: "Prompt structure X produced valid JSON for task type Y"
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - All requirements for '# Objective 4: Learn Successful JSON Patterns' are implemented and functional.
  - **Estimated Effort**: Medium
