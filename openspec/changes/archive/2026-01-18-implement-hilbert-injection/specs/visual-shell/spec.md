## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Hilbert Memory Visualization
The system SHALL visualize memory regions using fractal space-filling curves.

#### Scenario: Memory Folding
-   **WHEN** raw memory bytes are visualized
-   **THEN** they are mapped to 2D space using a Hilbert Curve
-   **VISUAL** Contiguous memory blocks appear as clustered geometric regions, not lines.
