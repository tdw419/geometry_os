# Proposal: Implement 14n Series Topological Logic

## Context
The system has achieved "Glass Box" status (Phase 26), efficiently rendering neural state as simple geometric primitives. However, the current visualization relies on arbitrary sine-wave deformations. The **Geometry OS Manifesto** calls for a shift to **Topological Computation**, specifically modeling logic using **14n Series Transition Metal Carbonyl Clusters**.

## Objective
Replace the current `generate_geometry` logic in `thought_geometry.wgsl` with a "Skeletal Logic" system based on the 14n series numerical matrix.

## Impact
- **Visual**: Thoughts will appear as stable geometric clusters (e.g., Octahedra for stable logic) rather than simple spheres.
- **Topological**: System state will be maintained via "Knot Invariants" ($14n + q$).
- **Performance**: Leveraging the "Pixel CPU" to calculate cluster stability in parallel.
- **PAS Score**: Expected to improve Stability by providing mathematical rigor to the visual layer.

## Risk
- High complexity in WGSL math.
- Potential performance impact if cluster generation is too expensive per vertex.
