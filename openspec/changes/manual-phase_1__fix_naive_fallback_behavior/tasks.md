- [x] **Task 1**: Deliverable 1: **Objective 1: Refine Fallback Task Generation**
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - **Objective 1: Refine Fallback Task Generation** is completed and functional
  - **Estimated Effort**: Medium

- [x] **Task 2**: Deliverable 2: **Goal:** The fallback mechanism in `systems/roadmap/change_generator.py` should intelligently group related lines from the input roadmap into single, coherent tasks. It should not treat every single line as a distinct task.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

- [x] **Task 3**: Deliverable 3: The logic should identify a block of text related to a single "Objective" or "Goal".
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - The logic should identify a block of text related to a single "Objective" or "Goal". is completed and functional
  - **Estimated Effort**: Medium

- [x] **Task 4**: Deliverable 4: It should combine the "Goal" description and its associated "Tasks" or "Implementation" points into one deliverable in the generated `tasks.md`.
