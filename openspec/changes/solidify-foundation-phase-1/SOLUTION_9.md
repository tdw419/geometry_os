# Solution for Task: **Task 2**: Acquire and Link Signal Library: Download the specific version of `typed-signals` required by pixi-ui into '/lib/' or ensure it is available in node_modules. Verify that its types are accessible for TypeScript compilation.

Title: Proposed Solution to Change OpenSpec Task "Change ID: solidify-foundation-phase-1"

Context:
The Geometry OS project aims to create a fully functional desktop environment using the PiXiJS library for window management. This task is part of the OpenSpec framework, where users are required to provide detailed descriptions and implementation plans for solving complex system engineering problems. The current codebase has critical rendering libaries (pixi-ui) and signal handling systems commented out or missing. To proceed with building any interactive features in this Desktop Environment project, we must first establish the local linkages for these external assets so that core classes like WindowManager can be instantiated without runtime errors.

Problem Statement: The current codebase has critical rendering libaries (pixi-ui) and signal handling systems commented out or missing, which prevents us from using the Desktop Environment project to its fullest extent. To proceed with building any interactive features in this Desktop Environment project, we must first establish the local linkages for these external assets so that core classes like WindowManager can be instantiated without runtime errors.

Impact Assessment: The proposed solution to this task will require a medium-complexity level of implementation. This solution is relatively straightforward and should not present significant risks or dependencies. However, it does require the creation of a dedicated '/lib/' folder within the project root for the pixi-ui library. Additionally, there may be some dependency issues with certain files for the pixi-ui library that need to be resolved before this solution can be implemented successfully.

Success Criteria: This proposed solution should establish the local linkages required for core classes like WindowManager in order to build a functional desktop environment using PiXiJS, enabling the use of advanced features such as window management and signal handling capabilities. The design will utilize clear Markdown formatting with detailed instructions for creating files and running scripts.

Architectural Overview:
This proposed solution involves establishing a dedicated '/lib/' folder within the project root that contains all necessary files for the pixi-ui library. This includes necessary files such as 'pixi-ui/css' and 'pixi-ui/js'. The file paths required to create or modify these directories will be included in the proposed solution.
