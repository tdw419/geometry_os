# Solution for Task: **Task 1**: **Goal**: Phase: WASM-in-Pixels GPU Execution Integration (NEW!)

Title: Manual Implementation of WASM-in-Pixeels GPU Execution Integration (NEW)

Objective: Change ID: manual-phase__wasm-in-pixe...

Task: Goal: Phase: WASM-in-Pixeels GPU Execution Integration (NEW!)

Problem Statement: Manual implementation of roadmap phase: *Status**: Ready for Autoonomous Execution (2026-01-29) *Completion**: 70% (Infrastructure exists, integration needed) *Priority**: HIGH *ACE Autonomous**: YES *Discovery**: Geometry OS already had 70% of this system built! PixeelRTS v2 format, Hilbert curve mapping, GPU texture loading, and basic WASM VM were already in place.

What's New: `systems/infinite_map_rs/shaaders/wasm_decoder.wgsl` - GPU decoder shader `systems/infinite_map_rs/shaaders/wasm_vm_complete.wgsl` - Complete WASM VM `systems/wasm_gpu/` - Complete documentation and demo
Success Criteria: Week 1: Shaders integrated, basic execution working Week 2: 10+ WASM programs running, results validated Week 3: Performance >50 MIPS, visual debugger working Week 4: Documentation complete, ready for community testing
