# Proposal: ouroboro-synchronization

[Proposal for Area: System]

Area: System
Description:
Incomplete integration of hardware feeders, virtualization and transpiler
Priority: High
Affected Components: evolution_daemon

Problem Statement:
The current system architecture of the Geometry OS is incomplete due to lack of proper integration with hardware components. The issue is highlighted by the inability to switch between different operating systems and the lack of transpiler for virtualization. The integration of these two features would enable users to run various software applications on their hardware, which would provide a significant benefit to the users.

Proposed Solution:
1. Implementation of hardware feeders: A hardware feeder is an essential component that allows users to connect their hardware devices to the Geometry OS. This implementation will help in providing seamless integration between hardware and software on the system.

2. Virtualization integration: With virtualization, it would be possible to run multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single computer without the need for physical partitions. The use of virtualization technology would enable users to switch from one operating system to another with ease.

3. Transpiler for virtualization: A transpiler is an application that converts the machine code generated by virtualization software into a native code that can be executed on the hardware. This integration will provide users with the ability to run multiple applications simultaneously, as they can switch between different operating systems without any compatibility issues.

Benefits:
The proposed solution would provide several benefits to users of Geometry OS. Firstly, it would enable them to switch seamlessly between various software applications on their hardware. Secondly, it will improve the efficiency and productivity of users by reducing the time required for setting up and configuring different operating systems. Lastly, it would simplify the process of managing multiple operating systems, enabling users to operate with greater ease and convenience.

Risks:
The implementation of hardware feeders, virtualization and transpiler may require some technical skills and expertise to set up and configure. The complexity of these features could also lead to errors or issues during the deployment process, which could negatively impact users' experience. However, with proper planning and testing, it is possible to mitigate any potential risks and ensure a smooth implementation.

TimeLine Estimate:
The implementation of the proposed solution will take around six months to complete. During this time, we will conduct thorough research, design and develop necessary components such as hardware feeders, virtualization technology, and transpiler. Once these components are in place, we will test them thoroughly before rolling them out to users.

Conclusion:
The proposed solution for the Area: System is a comprehensive proposal that provides significant benefits to Geometry OS users. The implementation of hardware feeder, virtualization, and transpiler would enable users to run multiple operating systems on their hardware with ease, which would enhance productivity and efficiency. In addition, the integration of these features would improve user experience by simplifying the process of managing multiple operating systems, reducing technical issues, and providing a seamless transition between different applications.
