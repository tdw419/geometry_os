# Design: manual-phase_1__enhance_robustness_and_feedback

## Architecture Overview
Manual Implementation: Phase 1: Enhance Robustness and Feedback

## Component Design
A detailed plan for implementing the roadmap phase: Phase 1: Enhance Robustness and Feedback. This was generated by the fallback mechanism.

## Implementation Plan
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 1: Enhance Robustness and Feedback due to an AI decomposition failure.

## Component Details
### **Goal**: Phase 1: Enhance Robustness and Feedback

**Description**: Modify `systems/roadmap/progress_tracker.py` to calculate and store these metrics. Enhance the output of `systems/roadmap/cli.py` to display a summary analytics table. Add a `--dry-run` argument to `systems/roadmap/cli.py`. In `systems/roadmap/roadmap_processor.py`, add logic to halt the process after OpenSpec generation if the dry-run flag is active and notify the user where to find the files. As the final step, execute the full test suite (`systems/roadmap/test_basic.py`). The entire run is only considered a success if all tests pass.

**Key Deliverables**:
- **Objective 1: Improve Feedback Loop Analytics**
- **Goal:** The `--analyze-feedback` command should provide more than just logs. It should compute and display key metrics like task success/failure rates and average execution time per task.
- **Tasks:**
- **Objective 2: Add a '--dry-run' Mode**
- **Goal:** Allow a user to preview the generated OpenSpec changes (`proposal.md`, `tasks.md`) without dispatching them to the MCP orchestrator for execution.
- **Tasks:**
- **Objective 3: System Integrity Validation**
- **Goal:** Ensure all changes introduced during this run have not compromised the system's core functionality.
- **Tasks:**

- All requirements for 'Phase 1: Enhance Robustness and Feedback' are implemented and functional.
- The implementation is tested and validated.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Acceptance tests based on success criteria

## Performance Considerations
- Estimated complexity: Medium
- Parallel execution where possible
- Resource optimization for autonomous execution
