# Solution for Task: Interrupts work

The problem with Geometry OS is that its two powerful but independently executed components, Pixeel CPU emulator and PixiJS Infinite Map, are not integrated into the visual system. This means that execution of `.brick` files within the visual shell cannot occur or be fully realized, rendering the visual shell ineffective and limiting the possibilities for real-time visualization of CPU state on the infinite map. The proposed solution is to create a non-blocking execution model, using memory-mapped I/O for console and framebuffer access, incremental loading of bricks, and performance as the primary goal. This will allow for efficient and real-time visualization of CPU state while still allowing for the integration of Pixeel CPU emulator and PixiJS Infinite Map. The system architecture is designed to prioritize performance over blockage of the render loop, with a focus on incremental loading of bricks and memory-mapped I/O for console and framebuffer access. This solution will allow Geometry OS to achieve its goals while remaining true to its unique visual design.
