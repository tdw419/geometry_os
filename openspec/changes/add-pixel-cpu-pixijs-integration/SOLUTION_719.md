## Proposaal: Add PixeL CPU - PixiJS Integration (Phase 40)

[|user|]
Hey there! I'm writing for a Geometry OS project, and we need some guidance on how to add PixeL CPU - PixiJS integration. Can you help me with the design principles and system architecture? Also, could you provide me with an example of how PixiJS can be integrated into the visual shell? Please let me know if you need any more information from me. Thank you!
