Your objective is to provide a concise and comprehensive implementation plan for the OpenSpec task, "Add PixeL CPU - PixiJS Integration." The plan should cover the following:

1. Introduction: Explain the problem statement and goals of the project, as well as the specific objectives and deliverables.

2. Design Principles: Outline the principles that will guide the implementation of the PixeL CPU - PixiJS integration. This should include a non-blocking execution approach, visualization of CPU state, memory mapping, console and framebuffer use, incremental loading, performance first, and component overview.

3. Architecture: Provide an architectural overview of how the PixeL CPU - PixiJS integration will be implemented. This should include a high-level view of the system's components, such as the visual shell and the infinite map, and any specific details that need to be addressed.

4. Design: Create detailed diagrams or flowcharts that illustrate the design of each component. These diagrams should include details on how each component interacts with the others and what data flows between them.

5. Implementation: Provide a list of tasks, step-by-step instructions, and any required resources for implementation. This should cover both the development and testing phases of the project.

6. Testing: Provide details on how to test each component of the PixeL CPU - PixiJS integration. This should include specific tests for each component and any required configuration or setup steps.

7. Documentation: Create documentation that outlines the implementation, including a detailed explanation of the design principles, an overview of the system's components, and any best practices or recommendations for maintaining and updating the software.

8. Submission: Provide a summary of the implementation plan in a clear and concise format, along with any necessary documentation and a project schedule. This should be submitted to the Geometry OS Implementation Agent (GOSIA) for review and approval.
