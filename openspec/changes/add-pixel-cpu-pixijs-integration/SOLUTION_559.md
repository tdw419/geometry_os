# Solution for Task: Performance is documented

[Design: PixeL CPU - PixiJS Integration]

1. Principles
   - Non-blocking execution of CPU state
   - Visualization of CPU state as part of infinite map
   - Memory-mapped I/O for simplicity
   - Incremental loading of brick files asyncrhonously
   - Performance first, component overview shown

2. System Architecture
   - Component Overview:
      - [Visual Shell (Broswer)]
         - [PixiJS Application]
            - InfiniteMap Class
            - file paths that need to be created or modified
               - [Briefly describe the python/rust code required for these steps]
               - Next Step command for user (e.g.: Create a file, run a script)
         - Plenty of clear Markdown formatting

3. User Interface Design
   - Files need to be created or modified using the Python/Rust code.
   - The user is prompted with a 'Next Step' command for the creation/run of the code.
   - The InfiniteMap class should be included in the PixiJS Application.
   - Include clear Markdown formatting throughout the user interface design.
