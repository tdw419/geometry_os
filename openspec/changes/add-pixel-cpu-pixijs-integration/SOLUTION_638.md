# Solution for Task: Brick file is created

Principles:
1. Non-blocking execution: CPU state is visualized as part of the infinite map to prevent blocking the render loop.
2. Visual-first approach: CPU state is visualized as part of the infinite map, allowing for easy and intuitive navigation.
3. Memory-mapped I/O: Console and framebuffer use memory-mapped I/O for simplicity.
4. Incremental loading: Brick files are loaded asyncrhonously to maintain 60 FPS during CPU execution.
5. Performance first: Maintenance of 60 FPS during CPU execution is prioritized over visual performance.

Component Overview:
1. Visual Shell (browser): It consists of a web browser, which can be accessed through different devices and platforms.
2. PixiJS Application: This component provides an interface to the PixiJS Infinite Map class, which is used for displaying real-time visual tiles in the infinite map.
3. InfiniteMap Class: This Python or Rust code is required to create or modify file paths that need to be created or modified by the user.
4. Next Step Command: A 'Next Step' command for the user (e.g. Create a file, run a script) is provided.
