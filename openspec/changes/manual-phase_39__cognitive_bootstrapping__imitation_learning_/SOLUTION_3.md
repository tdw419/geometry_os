# Solution for Task: **Task 1**: **Goal**: Phase 39: Cognitive Bootstrapping (Imitation Learning)

Title: Design and Implementation Plan for Phase 39: CoGNITIVE BOOTSTRAPPING (Imitation Learning)

Introduction
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: *Problem*: The RL agent starts with random weights (epsilon exploration). Converging to complex behavioral patterns solely through random clicking is statisticalistically impossible ("Sparse reward problem"). The goal of this plan is to provide a concise, clear, and detailed design and implementation plan for the Phase 39: CoGNITIVE BOOTSTRAPPING (Imitation Learning) task.

Goal
The main goal of this phase is to clone the behavior of the hardcoded heuristics to pre-train the brain in a more efficient way. The primary objective is to make RL agents capable of performing complex tasks like logging in without the need for random clicking. The secondary objectives are:
1. Reducing the risk of statistical errors and increasing the likelihood of successful learning.
2. Minimizing the computational resources required for training.
3. Improving the performance of RL agents through the use of pre-trained models.

Scope and Dependencies
The scope of this phase is to implement a manual implementation of Phase 39: CoGNITIVE BOOTSTRAPPING (Imitation Learning). The primary dependencies are:
1. Pre-training the RL agent using a hardcoded heuristic solution.
2. Cloning the behavior of the hardcoded heuristics to pre-train the brain.

Success Critieria
The success criterion for this phase is to meet the following requirements:
1. The RL agent will be able to perform complex tasks like logging in with a more efficient way than random clicking alone.
2. The RL agent will be able to perform these complex tasks without being exposed to epsilon-exploitation, which can result in statistical errors.
3. The implementation of this phase will lead to a significant reduction in the computational resources required for training.
4. The pre-trained models developed through this phase will improve the performance of RL agents in future phases.
