# Change: manual-phase_4__meta-learning_prompts

## Problem Statement
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: The system should learn from its mistakes not just by code fixes, but by evolving its own instructions.

## Proposed Solution
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 4: Meta-Learning Prompts

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Medium complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (automated implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- **Goal**: Phase 4: Meta-Learning Prompts

**Description**: The system should learn from its mistakes not just by code fixes, but by evolving its own instructions.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Create `PromptOptimizer` that analyzes failed vs successful tasks
- Implement a system for the `EvolutionDaemon` to propose updates to `ChangeGenerator` system prompts
- Create a `DynamicPromptRegistry` where identifying high-performing prompts are stored
