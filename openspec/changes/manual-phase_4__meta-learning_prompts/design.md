# Design: manual-phase_4__meta-learning_prompts

## Architecture Overview
Manual Implementation: Phase 4: Meta-Learning Prompts

## Component Design
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: The system should learn from its mistakes not just by code fixes, but by evolving its own instructions.

## Implementation Plan
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 4: Meta-Learning Prompts

## Component Details
### **Goal**: Phase 4: Meta-Learning Prompts

**Description**: The system should learn from its mistakes not just by code fixes, but by evolving its own instructions.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Create `PromptOptimizer` that analyzes failed vs successful tasks
- Implement a system for the `EvolutionDaemon` to propose updates to `ChangeGenerator` system prompts
- Create a `DynamicPromptRegistry` where identifying high-performing prompts are stored

- All requirements for 'Phase 4: Meta-Learning Prompts' are implemented and functional.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Acceptance tests based on success criteria

## Performance Considerations
- Estimated complexity: Medium
- Parallel execution where possible
- Resource optimization for autonomous execution
