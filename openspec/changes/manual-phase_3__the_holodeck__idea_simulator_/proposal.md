# Change: manual-phase_3__the_holodeck__idea_simulator_

## Problem Statement
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: Before verifying code, we must verify *ideas*. The system needs a sandbox to prototype and test architectural changes safely.

## Proposed Solution
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 3: The Holodeck (Idea Simulator)

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Medium complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (automated implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- **Goal**: Phase 3: The Holodeck (Idea Simulator)

**Description**: Before verifying code, we must verify *ideas*. The system needs a sandbox to prototype and test architectural changes safely.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Create `SimulationSandbox`: An isolated Python environment for safe execution of prototype code.
- Implement `IdeaValidator`: An agent that generates simple "proof of concept" tests for abstract ideas.
- Build `OutcomePredictor`: A module that uses historical data to predict the success probability of a proposed change.
- Integrate Simulation Step into `RoadmapProcessor`: Run simulation before generating final OpenSpec.
