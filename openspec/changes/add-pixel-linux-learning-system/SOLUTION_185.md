# Solution for Task: Constant propagation opportunities are detected

## System Architecture

1. **Layers**: The Pixeel Linux Learning and Improvement System is divided into several layers. These layers are:
   - **Performance Monitoring**: This layer tracks CPU execution metrics in real-time, including frame rate, memory usage, instruction counts, and cycle counts.
   - **Data Analysis**: The data analysis layer analyzes the performance monitoring data to identify patterns and opportunities for optimization.
   - **Optimization Engine**: The optimization engine applies machine learning techniques to generate optimized code and optimize system performance.
   - **Automation**: Automated testing and continuous optimization are facilitated by the automation layer.
   - **Knowledge Base**: A knowledge base is created with a repository of learned optimization patterns and techniques.
   
2. **Performance Monitoring Layer**: The Performance Monitoring layer is responsible for tracking CPU execution metrics in real-time. This includes monitoring the execution time per frame, frame rate, memory usage, instruction count, and cycle count. These data are collected from various sources, such as GPUs, CPUs, or system logs.
   
3. **Data Analysis Layer**: The Data Analysis layer analyzes this performance monitoring data to identify patterns and opportunities for optimization. This includes identifying bottlenecks in the code, analyzing memory usage, and identifying CPU usage patterns.
   
4. **Optimization Engine Layer**: The Optimization Engine layer applies machine learning techniques to generate optimized code and optimize system performance. This involves training a neural network on historical execution data to predict future performance.
   
5. **Automation Layer**: Automated testing is facilitated by the automation layer. This includes creating continuous integration systems for automating tests, running tests across various environments, and providing reports of test results.
   
6. **Knowledge Base Layer**: The Knowledge Base layer is a repository of learned optimization patterns and techniques. This allows developers to quickly search for previously optimized solutions or apply new techniques to existing code.
   
Overall, the Pixeel Linux Learning and Improvement System is designed to be self-learning and iterative, with the ability to continuously improve based on data analysis and feedback from users.
