# Solution for Task: Instructions are recorded correctly

Design: PixeL Linux Learning and Improvement System

1. Observe - PiXeL CPU executes RISC-V instructions in real-time, observing its execution patterns and performance. Observation-first approach ensures that no learning is done before observing the data to improve. This phase generates a repository of learned optimization patterns using AI-powered algorithms.

2. Analyze - Analyze the observed data generated in the previous phase to identify trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities for improvement. The system analyzes the execution metrics (execution time, FPS, memory usage, instruction count) to determine patterns of performance and identify areas of optimizations.

3. Evaluate - After analyzing the data, evaluate the identified patterns to determine which optimization should be implemented first. Based on the results, the system generates a list of recommended optimization suggestions for subsequent phases.

4. Validation - Validate all suggested optimization improvements by running them and measuring their performance impact. This ensures that no optimization is introduced without improving performance or adding unnecessary overhead.

5. Explainable - Provide an explanation of how the implemented optimization works, why it was chosen over other alternatives, and provide a rationale for the recommended solution. The system explains its reasoning to stakeholders during the design phase to build trust and confidence in the learning process.
