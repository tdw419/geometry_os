# Solution for Task: Patterns are extracted accurately

## Principles

1. Observe: The PixeL CPU system must observe its execution patterns and performance before learning.
2. Analyze: The PixeL CPU system should analyze the observed data to determine optimal optimization strategies.
3. Incremental: All decisions based on measured data should be incrementally implemented rather than all at once.
4. Validation Required: All optimization strategies must be validated by a human expert before being applied to real-world systems.
5. Explainable: The PixeL CPU system must explain its optimization strategies in plain language for users who may not understand complex algorithms.

## System Architecture

1. Performance Monitor: This class monitors performance metrics in real-time and records them for analysis later. It can be implemented as a library or a separate application.
2. Learning System: The learning system will analyze the observed data to determine optimal optimization strategies. It will use machine learning algorithms to learn from historical execution data and make predictions about future performance.
3. Experimenter Interface: This interface allows users to create experiments by providing file paths, python/rust code snippets, and a "Next Step" command. The system can then run the experiment and provide metrics and insights for the user.
4. User Interface: A user-friendly interface will allow users to easily create and modify experiments. This interface will also provide visualization tools to help users understand performance trends over time.
5. Documentation: The documentation will include clear, concise instructions on how to use each component of the system. It should also include best practices for optimizing code and troubleshooting common issues.
