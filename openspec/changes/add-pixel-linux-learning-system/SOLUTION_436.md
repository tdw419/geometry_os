## Principles

1. **Observation-First**: System must observe before learning
2. **Data-Driven**: All decisions based on measured data
3. **Incremental Learning**: Learn gradually, not all at once
4. **Validated**: All optimizations must be validated
5. **Explainable**: System must explain why optimizations work

## System Architecture

1. Performance Monitor: This class monitors real-time execution metrics in a system using a customized performance monitor library. The performance monitor collects and tracks CPU execution time, frame rate, memory usage, instruction count, and cycle count.
2. Window Size: The window size of the performance monitor is 1000 frames per second (fps). This setting ensures that the system captures a sufficient number of frames to provide accurate metrics.
3. Roll-Up Rolling Window: The performance monitor uses a rolling window to capture and track metrics over time. The window size can be adjusted based on the frequency requirements for monitoring different types of systems.
4. Roll-Up Window Size: The roll-up window size is used to calculate the average execution time, frame rate, memory usage, instruction count, and cycle count per fps.
5. Roll-Up Window Functions: The performance monitor uses a customized function to calculate these metrics. The function calculates the average execution time (executionTime), frame rate (fpS), memory usage (memoryUsage), instructionCount (instructionCount), and cycleCount (cycleCount) for each frame in the roll-up window.
