# Solution for Task: Performance is monitored

[Leverage existing tools and technologies to optimize the learning system](https://github.com/GeometryOS/Phase41/issues/1). This includes leveraging machine learning models, neural networks, and deep learning frameworks for data analysis and pattern recognition.

[Develop a performance monitoring system](https://github.com/GeometryOS/Phase41/issues/2) that tracks CPU execution metrics in real-time. This includes the following features:

1. CPU execution time per frame (in milliseconds).
2. Frame rate (frames per second).
3. Memory usage (RAM and swap space usage).
4. Instruction count.
5. Cycle count.

[Develop a self-improvement capability](https://github.com/GeometryOS/Phase41/issues/3) that allows the learning system to learn from its own execution results. This includes leveraging AI-powered techniques for automated testing, optimization, and pattern recognition.

[Develop a library for automatic testing of performance-critical applications](https://github.com/GeometryOS/Phase41/issues/4) that provides a simple way to write unit tests for complex applications. This library should support multiple programming languages and frameworks, including Python, Rust, and Java.

[Develop an automated performance tuning framework](https://github.com/GeometryOS/Phase41/issues/5) that uses machine learning models to identify optimizations for specific use cases. This includes tools for analyzing the performance of various code snippets and generating optimized versions.

[Document and maintain a knowledge base for performance optimization techniques](https://github.com/GeometryOS/Phase41/issues/6) that provides detailed information on commonly used techniques, best practices, and case studies. This knowledge base should be accessible to both developers and end users.

[Develop a repository of learned optimization patterns](https://github.com/GeometryOS/Phase41/issues/7) that provides a reference for developers who want to apply specific optimization techniques in their own code. This repository should include detailed explanations, examples, and benchmarks.
