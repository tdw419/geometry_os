# Solution for Task: Metrics are tracked in real-time

Title: PixeL Linux Learning and Improvement System (Phase 41)

Introduction
- Problem statement: Geometry OS has successfully implemented PixeL CPU - PixiJS integration with the ability to execute `.brick` files containing RISC-V instructions, boot a simulated RISC-V Linux kernel, and display framebuffer output and console I/O. However, the system lacks self-improvement capabilities, learning mechanisms, LLM integration, automatic testing, performance optimization, knowledge base, and repository of learned optimization patterns.
- Solution: Phase 41: PixeL Linux Learning and Improvement System (Phase 41)
- Principles: Observation-first, data-driven, incremental learning, validation required, explainable, and observation layered.
- Architecture: Layer 1: Performance monitoring layer, layer 2: training, layer 3: optimization, layer 4: learning, layer 5: performance evaluation, layer 6: deployment, layer 7: maintenance, layer 8: documentation and feedback loop.
- Design: Observe first, data driven, incremental learning, validate, explainable, observation layered, and training/optimization layers.
