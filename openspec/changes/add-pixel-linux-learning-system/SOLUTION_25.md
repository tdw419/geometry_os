### Layer 2: Learning and Improvement Layer

```javascript
/**
 * Self-Improvement and Learning
 * This layer is responsible for learning from the system's own execution, identifying patterns and optimizing performance.
 */
class LearningAndImprovement {
     /**
      * Initialize the learning and improvement system
      */
    constructor() {
         this.learning = new Learning(this);
         this.impovement = new Impovement(this);
         this.analysis = new Analysis(this);
    }

    /**
     * Observe the system's execution patterns and performance
     */
    observe() {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * Analyze the observed execution patterns and performance
     */
    analyze() {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * Improve the system's performance by applying learned optimization techniques
     */
    optimize() {
        // ...
    }
}
```

### Layer 3: Repository and Integration Layer

```javascript
/**
 * AI-powered learning and optimization system repository
 * This layer is responsible for storing the learned optimization techniques, patterns, and performance improvements.
 */
class LearningAndImprovementRepository {
     /**
      * Initialize the repository
      */
    constructor() {
         this.learning = new Learning();
         this.impovement = new Impovement();
         this.analysis = new Analysis();
    }

    /**
     * Store a learned optimization technique or pattern
     */
    store(learning, improvement) {
        // ...
    }

    /**
     * Retrieve stored optimization techniques and patterns
     */
    retrieve() {
        // ...
    }
}
```
