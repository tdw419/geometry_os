# Pixelrts Vision Phase1.1 Advanced Pattern Detection

## Summary

Add computer vision algorithms (edge detection, Fourier analysis, clustering) to the PixelRTS Vision Analyzer for automated binary structure pattern detection.

## Motivation

This change implements the architecture described below, enabling spec-driven development
and verification of the implementation.

## Architecture

- Extend `pixelrts_vision_analyzer.py` with pattern detection methods using OpenCV/scikit-image

## Tech Stack

- OpenCV (cv2) - Edge detection, image processing
