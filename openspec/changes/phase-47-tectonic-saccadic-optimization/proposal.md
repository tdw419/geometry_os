# Phase 47 Tectonic Saccadic Optimization

## Summary

Implement biologically-plausible "eye movement" rendering for seamless LOD transitions and predictive tile pre-fetching in the infinite Hilbert map.

## Motivation

This change implements the architecture described below, enabling spec-driven development
and verification of the implementation.

## Architecture

- **Saccadic Movement Controller**: Simulates biological eye saccades (quick jumps with exponential settling)

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6+) for browser-based rendering
