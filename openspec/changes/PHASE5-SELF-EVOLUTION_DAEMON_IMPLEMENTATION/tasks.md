# Tasks: PHASE5-SELF-EVOLUTION_DAEMON_IMPLEMENTATION

- [x] **Task 1**: Design SelfEvolutionDaemon architecture and component interfaces defining how the daemon interacts with existing system components including optimization discovery modules evaluation frameworks modification application logic monitoring subsystems safety governor integration points scheduling mechanism for periodic execution lifecycle management interface definitions.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Architecture document includes detailed diagrams showing all major Daemon subcomponents their interactions data flows control paths
    - All required component interfaces are defined in technical specifications with clear input output contracts and error handling requirements
  - **Estimated Effort**: Medium

- [x] **Task 2**: Implement Truth Engine safety governor system that evaluates proposed modifications against predefined criteria including alignment checks capability preservation tests performance impact assessments bias detection security vulnerability scanning functional integrity verification to prevent harmful or unintended changes from being applied.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Truth Engine successfully rejects all test cases representing unsafe modification attempts
    - Governor provides clear audit log and explanation for why each rejected change was deemed unacceptable
  - **Estimated Effort**: Large

- [x] **Task 3**: Design Evolution Cycle protocol specifying exactly when optimizations are discovered how they're evaluated prioritized applied tracked monitored including scheduling intervals trigger conditions success/failure criteria rollback mechanisms version control integration with existing system components and reporting requirements for human oversight.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Evolution cycle specification includes clear step-by-step process definitions
    - Protocol defines all edge cases error handling scenarios failure recovery procedures
  - **Estimated Effort**: Medium

- [x] **Task 4**: Implement the SelfEvolutionDaemon core functionality including periodic execution loop optimization discovery and evaluation safety governor integration modification application version tracking monitoring alerting configuration management user interface for oversight controls.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Self-Evolution Daemon successfully executes complete evolution cycle on test environment
    - All components integrate properly with existing system without breaking changes or performance degradation
  - **Estimated Effort**: Large

- [x] **Task 5**: Implement comprehensive testing and validation of the entire autonomous improvement loop including unit tests for individual daemon subcomponents integration tests between all interacting systems end-to-end evolution cycle simulation stress testing safety governor effectiveness load impact analysis regression suite to ensure no regressions in existing functionality.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - All acceptance criteria from previous tasks are validated through automated test cases
    - Test results document demonstrates safe operation of autonomous improvement loop with documented failure scenarios and recovery procedures
  - **Estimated Effort**: Large

- [x] **Task 6**: Create comprehensive documentation including architecture diagrams component specifications usage guides for system administrators safety governor configuration reference implementation examples evolution cycle monitoring dashboards operational runbooks troubleshooting guide security considerations.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Documentation covers all aspects of the Self-Evolution Daemon from development to production use
    - All user-facing and administrator-focused documents are complete reviewed approved
    - Operational procedures include clear steps for manual intervention when needed
  - **Estimated Effort**: Medium


## Summary
- **Total Tasks**: 6
- **Estimated Complexity**: Large
- **Dependencies**: None
