# Change: PHASE5-SELF-EVOLUTION_DAEMON_IMPLEMENTATION

## Problem Statement
Develop the core architecture, components, protocols necessary to enable an AI agent's recursive self-improvement capabilities in automated cycles. This includes designing how optimizations are discovered evaluated applied safely without direct human intervention creating mechanisms that prevent runaway modifications or harmful changes establishing clear boundaries and governance for autonomous evolution processes ensuring system integrity stability over time.

## Proposed Solution
Without a structured approach to automatic improvement the AI cannot evolve beyond its current state autonomously leading to stagnation. However uncontrolled self-modification poses significant risks including unintended behavior loss of alignment safety violations degradation or corruption of core capabilities making it essential to implement robust governance mechanisms before enabling autonomous evolution loops.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Large complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (automated implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- Design SelfEvolutionDaemon architecture and component interfaces defining how the daemon interacts with existing system components including optimization discovery modules evaluation frameworks modification application logic monitoring subsystems safety governor integration points scheduling mechanism for periodic execution lifecycle management interface definitions.
- Implement Truth Engine safety governor system that evaluates proposed modifications against predefined criteria including alignment checks capability preservation tests performance impact assessments bias detection security vulnerability scanning functional integrity verification to prevent harmful or unintended changes from being applied.
- Design Evolution Cycle protocol specifying exactly when optimizations are discovered how they're evaluated prioritized applied tracked monitored including scheduling intervals trigger conditions success/failure criteria rollback mechanisms version control integration with existing system components and reporting requirements for human oversight.
- Implement the SelfEvolutionDaemon core functionality including periodic execution loop optimization discovery and evaluation safety governor integration modification application version tracking monitoring alerting configuration management user interface for oversight controls.
- Implement comprehensive testing and validation of the entire autonomous improvement loop including unit tests for individual daemon subcomponents integration tests between all interacting systems end-to-end evolution cycle simulation stress testing safety governor effectiveness load impact analysis regression suite to ensure no regressions in existing functionality.
- Create comprehensive documentation including architecture diagrams component specifications usage guides for system administrators safety governor configuration reference implementation examples evolution cycle monitoring dashboards operational runbooks troubleshooting guide security considerations.
