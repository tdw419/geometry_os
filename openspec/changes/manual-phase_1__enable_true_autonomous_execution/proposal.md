# Change: manual-phase_1__enable_true_autonomous_execution

## Problem Statement
A detailed plan for implementing the roadmap phase: Phase 1: Enable True Autonomous Execution. This was generated by the fallback mechanism.

## Proposed Solution
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 1: Enable True Autonomous Execution due to an AI decomposition failure.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Medium complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (automated implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- **Goal**: Phase 1: Enable True Autonomous Execution

**Description**: Create a new file: `systems/roadmap/mcp_bridge.py`. Implement a class `MCPBridge` that can connect to the orchestrator. Add a `mock_mcp_server.py` to the `systems/roadmap/` directory.

**Key Deliverables**:
- **Objective 1: Implement MCP Orchestrator Bridge**
- **Goal:** Create a communication bridge in `systems/roadmap/` that can connect to an MCP Orchestrator server and dispatch tasks from a generated `tasks.md` file.
- **Tasks:**
- The bridge should have a method to parse an `OpenSpecChangeSpec` and send the contained tasks to the MCP for execution.
- **Objective 2: Integrate Bridge into the Main Workflow**
- **Goal:** Modify `systems/roadmap/roadmap_processor.py` to use the new `MCPBridge`.
- **Tasks:**
- When a roadmap is processed and the `--dry-run` flag is NOT present, the `RoadmapProcessor` should instantiate and call the `MCPBridge` to dispatch the generated tasks.
- Add logging to indicate that tasks have been successfully dispatched to the orchestrator.
- **Objective 3: Create a Mock MCP Server for Testing**
- **Goal:** To ensure the bridge works without depending on a live MCP instance, create a mock server for the test suite.
- **Tasks:**
- This mock server will accept task requests and log that they were received.
- Update `systems/roadmap/test_basic.py` to start this mock server and have a new test assert that the `MCPBridge` successfully connects and sends tasks to it.
