# Change: manual-phase_5__the_ouroboros_daemon

## Problem Statement
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: Automating the loop. The system should run periodically, checking for optimizations and applying them without direct human triggering.

## Proposed Solution
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 5: The Ouroboros Daemon

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Medium complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (automated implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- **Goal**: Phase 5: The Ouroboros Daemon

**Description**: Automating the loop. The system should run periodically, checking for optimizations and applying them without direct human triggering.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Design the `SelfEvolutionDaemon` architecture
- Create safety governors (Truth Engine) to prevent "runaway" modifications
- Implement a standardized "Evolution Cycle" protocol
