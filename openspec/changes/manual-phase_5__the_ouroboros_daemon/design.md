# Design: manual-phase_5__the_ouroboros_daemon

## Architecture Overview
Manual Implementation: Phase 5: The Ouroboros Daemon

## Component Design
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: Automating the loop. The system should run periodically, checking for optimizations and applying them without direct human triggering.

## Implementation Plan
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 5: The Ouroboros Daemon

## Component Details
### **Goal**: Phase 5: The Ouroboros Daemon

**Description**: Automating the loop. The system should run periodically, checking for optimizations and applying them without direct human triggering.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Design the `SelfEvolutionDaemon` architecture
- Create safety governors (Truth Engine) to prevent "runaway" modifications
- Implement a standardized "Evolution Cycle" protocol

- All requirements for 'Phase 5: The Ouroboros Daemon' are implemented and functional.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Acceptance tests based on success criteria

## Performance Considerations
- Estimated complexity: Medium
- Parallel execution where possible
- Resource optimization for autonomous execution
