# Change: roadmap-parser-test-fix-v001

## Problem Statement
Comprehensive investigation of failing parser tests to identify root causes. Implementation of necessary code corrections in the parsing logic, followed by validation through test execution.

## Proposed Solution
Parser module is experiencing critical failures that prevent successful data processing operations across multiple components relying on this functionality. These issues must be resolved before proceeding with subsequent development phases and feature implementation workloads.

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Medium complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (automated implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- Investigate failing parser test logs to identify specific error patterns, stack traces, and failure conditions for each failed unit or integration test case.
- Analyze Parser implementation code against expected behavior specifications to validate correctness of parsing logic and identify discrepancies between current state and requirements.
- Implement code corrections for identified parser failures including bug fixes, boundary condition handling improvements, and error message enhancements.
- Execute full test suite for Parser module including unit tests, integration tests and regression testing across all affected components.
