# Tasks: roadmap-parser-test-fix-v001

- [x] **Task 1**: Investigate failing parser test logs to identify specific error patterns, stack traces, and failure conditions for each failed unit or integration test case.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - All identified failures documented with exact line numbers
    - Root cause hypothesis created based on log analysis
  - **Estimated Effort**: Medium

- [x] **Task 2**: Analyze Parser implementation code against expected behavior specifications to validate correctness of parsing logic and identify discrepancies between current state and requirements.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - Code review completed identifying all issues
    - Detailed list of specific bugs or edge cases documented
  - **Estimated Effort**: Medium

- [x] **Task 3**: Implement code corrections for identified parser failures including bug fixes, boundary condition handling improvements, and error message enhancements.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - All changes committed to version control
    - Code reviewed by at least one team member
  - **Estimated Effort**: Large
  - **Dependencies**: Investigate failing logs

- [x] **Task 4**: Execute full test suite for Parser module including unit tests, integration tests and regression testing across all affected components.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - 100% of parser-related tests passing
    - No new failures introduced
  - **Estimated Effort**: Small
  - **Dependencies**: Implement code corrections


## Summary
- **Total Tasks**: 4
- **Estimated Complexity**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: None
