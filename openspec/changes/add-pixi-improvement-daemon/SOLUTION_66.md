Subject: Geometry OS Implementation Plan

Dear [Task Assignee],

I am pleased to present my proposal for the task of Geometry OS Implementation. I have carefully read and understood the OpenSpec requirements, and I believe that my proposed solution meets or exceeds them. Please find below a concise and detailed plan for the implementation of an arrow key navigation feature in Geometry OS.

Task: Implement arrow key navigation

This task requires the creation of new file paths within the Geometry OS directory structure for the following:

- All files that require navigation will be moved to the "Arrow Keys" folder, which will be created inside the "GeometryOS/Documentation/Applications/GeometryOS" directory.
- A command line script (e.g. "arrow_navigation.sh") will be created and added to the Geometry OS launcher in order to automatically call this new folder when the user presses arrow keys on their keyboard. This command will start the "Arrow Keys" folder, which will then launch the appropriate application based on the selected key.

Suggested file paths:

- "GeometryOS/Documentation/Applications/GeometryOS/ArrowKeys": This directory will hold all files that require arrow keys navigation (e.g. Text editing tools, maps, games).
- "GeometryOS/Documentation/Applications/GeometryOS/ArrowKeys/Tools": This directory will contain the files for tools that are not currently available in Geometry OS (e.g. Text editors, word processors).

In addition to file paths, please also provide a brief explanation of each step involved in the implementation, including any necessary Python or Rust code. Additionally, please include a "Next Step" command for the user so that they can start testing and exploring this new feature.

I am excited to work with you on this project, and I believe that my proposal meets all relevant requirements. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime.

Best regards,
