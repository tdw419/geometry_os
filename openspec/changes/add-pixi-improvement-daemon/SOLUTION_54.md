Write a comprehensive guide on how to use AWS Lambda and Amazon S3 to build a custom API Gateway using Node.js and Express. The guide should cover topics such as:
- Installing and configuring AWS Lambda and S3
- Creating an API Gateway with the desired API versioning, throttling, and caching policies
- Implementing authorization and token management using JWTs or OAuth2
- Deploying the API Gateway to a cloud environment and testing it
- Configuring logging and monitoring using AWS CloudWatch and Amazon SQS
- Adding support for custom resources (such as APIs) with Lambda functions
- Integrating with third-party services like DynamoDB or Redshift
- Securing the API Gateway with IAM roles, API keys, and TLS certificates

The guide should be written in clear and concise language, using examples where appropriate. It should also include screenshots, diagrams, or other visual aids to help readers understand complex concepts. The guide should be written in a style that is both accessible to AWS Lambda and S3 novices as well as experienced developers.
