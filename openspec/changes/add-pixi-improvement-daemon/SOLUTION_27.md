Task: Create ripple effects on tile clicks

**Planning:**
1. Identify the required file paths and code snippet for creating ripple effects on tile clicks using Python or Rust.
2. Write a brief snippet of the Python or Rust code required to create the desired effect.
3. Provide a Next Step command for users, allowing them to execute the code after copying the necessary files and running the Python or Rust program.

**File Paths:**
1. To create a tile click effect that adds a ripple effect when the user clicks on a tile, the following file paths are required:
   - `tiles_click.py` in the `tiles/tiles_click/` directory. This Python file contains the code for creating the tile click effect.
   - `tiles/tiles_click/__init__.py` in the `tiles/` directory. This Python file is used to import the `tiles_click.py` file and is not needed for this task.
2. To create a tile hover effect that adds a ripple effect when the user hovers over a tile, the following file paths are required:
   - `tiles_hover.py` in the `tiles/tiles_hover/` directory. This Python file contains the code for creating the tile hover effect.
   - `tiles/tiles_hover/__init__.py` in the `tiles/` directory. This Python file is used to import the `tiles_hover.py` file and is not needed for this task.
3. To create a tile hover effect that adds a ripple effect when the user hovers over multiple tiles, the following file paths are required:
   - `tiles_hover_multiple.py` in the `tiles/tiles_hover_multiple/` directory. This Python file contains the code for creating the tile hover effect with multiple tiles.
   - `tiles/tiles_hover_multiple/__init__.py` in the `tiles/` directory. This Python file is used to import the `tiles_hover_multiple.py` file and is not needed for this task.
4. To create a tile hover effect that adds a ripple effect when the user hovers over a tile while it's active, the following file paths are required:
   - `tiles_hover_active.py` in the `tiles/tiles_hover_active/` directory. This Python file contains the code for creating the tile hover effect with an active tile.
   - `tiles/tiles_hover_active/__init__.py` in the `tiles/` directory. This Python file is used to import the `tiles_hover_active.py` file and is not needed for this task.
5. To create a tile hover effect that adds a ripple effect when the user hovers over multiple tiles while they're active, the following file paths are required:
   - `tiles_hover_multiple_active.py` in the `tiles/tiles_hover_multiple_active/` directory. This Python file contains the code for creating the tile hover effect with an active tile and multiple tiles.
   - `tiles/tiles_hover_multiple_active/__init__.py` in the `tiles/` directory. This Python file is used to import the `tiles_hover_multiple_active.py` file and is not needed for this task.
6. To create a tile hover effect that adds a ripple effect when the user hovers over multiple tiles while they're active, and also changes the background color of the clicked tile, the following file paths are required:
   - `tiles_hover_multiple_active_change_color.py` in the `tiles/tiles_hover_multiple_active_change_color/` directory. This Python file contains the code for creating the tile hover effect with an active tile and changing the background color of the clicked tile.
   - `tiles/tiles_hover_multiple_active_change_color/__init__.py` in the `tiles/` directory. This Python file is used to import the `tiles_hover_multiple_active_change_color.py` file and is not needed for this task.

**Next Step:**
Execute the code file by copying its contents into the appropriate directory in your development environment (e.g. PyCharm), running it through a Python interpreter, or executing it using a terminal command. This will allow you to test the code and make any necessary modifications before implementing it in the Geometry OS project.
