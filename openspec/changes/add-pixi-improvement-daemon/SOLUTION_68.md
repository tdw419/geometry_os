# Solution for Task: Create configurable key bindings

Title: GeometryOS Implementation Guide - Change ID: Add PiiXi Improvement Daemon

Introduction:
The goal of this GeometryOS Implementation Guide is to provide a concise implementation plan or code solution for the OpenSpec task of changing the PiXi key binding system. The task requires creating configurable key bindings, and our implementation will address this requirement by providing files and commands for users to customize their input methods.

Context:
The PiXi key binding system was added in version 4.0 of GeometryOS, but has not yet been fully implemented into the OS. This task aims to provide a more user-friendly way for users to configure their input methods. Our implementation will create and modify Python or Rust code that allows for easy customization of key bindings.

Task Breakdown:
1. File Paths Required: The first step in the implementation plan is to provide a brief list of the file paths required, such as `/system/config` or `/user/.config/geometryos`. This will allow users to easily locate these files for modification.

2. Python Code Required: Next, we will provide a snippet of Python code that can be used to create and modify key bindings. The code should be easy to understand and follow, with clear variable names and comments. The code should also handle any input validation or error handling appropriately.

3. Rust Code Required: To provide an implementation for the Python code, we will need a similar set of files in the `system/config` or `user/.config/geometryos` directory. The rust code would then be used to create and modify the key bindings as needed.

4. 'Next Step' Commands: To complete this task, we will provide clear instructions on how users can use these files and commands to customize their input methods. For example, after creating or modifying a key binding, users can save it by running the `geometryos config` command. This will create a JSON file in the `user/.config/geometryos` directory that contains the new key binding.

Conclusion:
By following these steps and providing clear instructions on how to customize input methods using GeometryOS, we hope to provide an easier and more user-friendly way for users to configure their input methods. We welcome any feedback or suggestions from users during the implementation process.
