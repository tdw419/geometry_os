Task: Create screen reader announcements

Planning steps:
1. Define the task requirements: The main goal of this task is to improve Geometry OS's screen reader announcements by adding new phrases or sentences that can be used as captions for different geometric shapes, such as circles, squares, triangles, etc.

2. Gather necessary information: Once the task requirements are defined, gather all relevant information such as file paths that need to be created or modified, a brief snippet of Python or Rust code required, and next steps to be taken for implementation.

3. Create a plan: Develop a clear and organized plan based on the given requirements. This could involve creating a document with the necessary details, such as file paths, code snippets, and steps to follow to create the required announcements.

4. Test the plan: Once the plan is created, test it thoroughly to ensure that it meets all the requirements and works as expected. This may include running the code on a test environment or using the proposed solution in real-time scenarios.

Implementation steps:
1. Create file paths: Based on the given requirements, create appropriate directories where announcements can be stored. For example, `announcements/circle` for adding circle announcements, `announcements/square` for adding square announcements, etc.
2. Generate Python or Rust code: Using the information from the previous step, generate a code snippet that will add new phrases to the announcement files. The code could be in Python or Rust and could include variables representing geometry objects such as circles or squares.
3. Test the implementation: Once the code is created, test it thoroughly to ensure that it meets all the requirements. This may involve running the code on a test environment or using the proposed solution in real-time scenarios.
4. Create announcement files: Using the generated code, create announcement files for different geometric shapes. For example, create a file named `announcements/circle` with the new phrases and place it in the appropriate directory.
5. Update Geometry OS: Once the announcement files are created, update Geometry OS to include them. The announcements could be added to the `geom_os.xml` file or updated through a web interface.
6. Test the updates: Finally, test the updates on real-world scenarios to ensure that they work as expected and provide better accessibility for people with visual impairments.

Conclusion:
By following these steps, you can create an implementation plan and code solution for adding new phrases or sentences to Geometry OS's screen reader announcements. Testing the implementation is crucial to ensure that it meets all requirements and works as expected.
