Subject: Implement Change ID: Add PIxi Improvement Daemon

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you as part of the Geometry OS Implementation Agent Team. My name is [Your Name], and I am the current Geometry OS Implementation Agent for the OpenSpec task titled "Add PIxi Improvement Daemon".

As per the task description, we have identified an issue with the tooltip positioning logic that needs to be improved. The following file paths need to be created or modified:

- `/usr/share/geomview/imagery/tooltips/pixti.json`: Contains information about the tooltips for PIxi, including their position and text.
- `/usr/share/geomview/imagery/tooltips/default_tooltip.xml`: Contains a default tooltip template that can be used as a reference for creating new tooltips.

As part of this task, we need to create a Python or Rust code snippet that performs the following actions:

1. Reads the `pixti.json` file and extracts the relevant information about PIxi's tooltips.
2. Uses this information to generate an appropriate tooltip for each PIxi image.
3. Updates the default `default_tooltip.xml` file with the new tooltips.

The proposed code should be written in a clear and concise manner, using Python or Rust language. It is also essential that the code adheres to best practices such as following PEP8 style guidelines and providing comments explaining what each line of code does.

To implement this task, please provide me with the file paths I need to create or modify. We will collaborate on this project, and we expect you to complete it within two weeks. If you are unable to complete the task within that time frame, please let us know why.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and we look forward to working with you.

Sincerely,
[Your Signature]
