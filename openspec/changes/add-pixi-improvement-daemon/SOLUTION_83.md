# Solution for Task: Add configurable scroll sensitivity

[Insert file paths here]

[Insert snippet of Python or Rust code required here]

1. [Next Step command (e.g. Create a file, run a script)]
This task requires a concise and comprehensive implementation plan or code solution for the OpenSpec task change ID: add-pixi-improvement-daemon. The following information provides a clear description of these requirements.

2. File Paths Needed:
- [Insert file paths here]
These file paths should be created or modified to ensure that the new scroll sensitivity is added to the GeometryOS driver code, as mentioned in the task description.

3. Code Requirement:
Create a Python or Rust function with the following signature and parameters:
```python
def add_scroll_sensitivity(geom_x1, geom_y1, geom_x2, geom_y2):
    """
    This function adds scroll sensitivity to GeometryOS driver.
    
    Parameters:
        geom_x1 (int): The x-coordinate of the first point on the screen.
        geom_y1 (int): The y-coordinate of the first point on the screen.
        geom_x2 (int): The x-coordinate of the second point on the screen.
        geom_y2 (int): The y-coordinate of the second point on the screen.
    """
    # Add scroll sensitivity logic here
```

4. Code Execution Command:
Run the Python or Rust function provided in step 3, passing in the necessary parameters for the scroll sensitivity to be added to the GeometryOS driver code. For example:
```bash
$ python add_scroll_sensitivity.py 100 50 150 250
```

5. Next Step Command:
Create a next step command (e.g. Create a file, run a script) that calls the Python or Rust function provided in step 3 to ensure the scroll sensitivity is added to the GeometryOS driver code. For example:
```bash
$ python add_scroll_sensitivity.py 100 50 150 250 > geometryos_scroll_sensitivity.py
$ nano geometryos_scroll_sensitivity.py
```

In conclusion, this task requires a concise and comprehensive implementation plan or code solution for the OpenSpec task change ID: add-pixi-improvement-daemon. The provided requirements are clear, detailed, and structured, providing a clear roadmap for accomplishing this task.
