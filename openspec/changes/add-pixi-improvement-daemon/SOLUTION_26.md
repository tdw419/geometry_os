# Solution for Task: Add border highlighting for selected tiles

[Context: Add-PiXi Improvement Daemon]

Goal: To provide a concise and comprehensive implementation plan or code solution for the OpenSpec task of adding border highlighting for selected tile layers in Geometry OS.

1. Context: The task involves modifying the `GeoDataTileImporter` daemon to add border highlighting for selected tile layers. The daemon will read a specific format from the input data and process it by creating or modifying files based on the input data. The code should be written in Python or Rust.

2. File Paths: The daemon will need to create or modify the following paths:
   - `input_tiles`: A directory that contains the input tiles, which should be created if it does not exist.
   - `output_tiles`: A directory where output tile data will be written. This directory will also serve as a place to store intermediate files generated by the daemon.

3. Python or Rust Code: The daemon can use Python's built-in `os` module to create directories and modify file permissions if necessary. The daemon should also utilize Rust's `fs::create_dir_all()` function to create a directory with the appropriate permissions. Alternatively, the daemon can write code using Python's `shutil` module to create or modify files.

4. Next Step: A user-friendly command that will guide the user through creating or modifying the selected tile layers and creating necessary files in the specified directories. This command should also provide instructions on how to run the daemon if desired. For example, "Create a new directory called 'output_tiles' and add it as a parent folder for the input tiles."

5. Testing: The code will need to be thoroughly tested before being deployed in production. This may require testing with various input data formats and different levels of complexity.

6. Documentation: To make it easier for other users to understand how to use the daemon, documentation should be provided that explains how to create or modify the directories and files. In addition, the code should also be documented in a clear and organized way using appropriate comments and indentation.
