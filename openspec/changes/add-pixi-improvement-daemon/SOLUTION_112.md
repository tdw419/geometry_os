# Solution for Task: Add group expand/collapse

**Context:**
Change ID: add-pixi-improvement-daemon
Task: Add group expand/collapses

**Planning:**
1. Change the `GeometryOS` module to include a new feature that allows users to expand or collapse groups of items using a simple button press. This feature should be implemented as an optional add-on for the GeometryOS user interface.
2. The new feature should be designed to work with existing group types and should not require any significant changes to the underlying database schema.
3. To ensure that the new feature is easy to use, we will provide a brief snippet of Python or Rust code that demonstrates how to add the expand/collapse functionality to existing geometry items.
4. Once the implementation is complete, we will create a simple step-by-step guide on our website detailing the necessary steps for users to enable the new feature.
5. We will also test the new feature extensively and ensure that it works as expected across multiple devices and platforms.
6. Finally, we will work with the GeometryOS team to ensure that the new feature is integrated into the official GeometryOS software as quickly as possible.
7. Once implemented, we will monitor user feedback and make any necessary updates or improvements to the new feature as needed.
