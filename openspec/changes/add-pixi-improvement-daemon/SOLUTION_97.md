# Solution for Task: Add cache size limits

<|user|>
Can you please provide me with the steps to implement the cache size limit feature in Geometry OS using OpenSpec? I want to work on this task and would like help from a mentor if possible. Please let me know if there are any specific requirements or guidelines that I need to follow.
