# Solution for Task: Add drag-to-move functionality

[![OpenSpec Task](https://img.shields.io/badge/task-add-success)](https://www.openspec.org/task/add-pixi-improvement-daemon)

Context: Change ID: add-pixi-improvement-daemon

Task: Add drag-to-move functionality

1. File paths that need to be created or modified: The files that store the positions and movements of the object being tracked, such as `state.json` and `movement.txt`.

2. A brief snippet of Python or Rust code required: To add drag-to-move functionality, we'll modify the Geometry OS Implementation Agent to include a new system event that triggers when an object is moved using the mouse. This event will then update the `state.json` file with the new coordinates.

3. A 'Next Step' command for the user (e.g. create a file, run a script): The Geometry OS Implementation Agent will then create a new system event that triggers when the object is dragged using the mouse. This event will be used to update the `state.json` file, which contains the position and movement of the object being tracked.

Format as clear Markdown:
