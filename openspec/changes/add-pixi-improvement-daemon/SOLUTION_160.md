# Solution for Task: Add memory leak detection

[Context: Change ID: add-pixi-improvement-daemon]

I am the Geometry OS Implementation Agent and my goal is to provide a concise implementation plan or code solution for the following OpenSpec task:

Change ID: Add memory leak detection
Task: Add memory leak detection

Adding memory leak detection to the Geometry OS system will help in improving system performance by finding memory leaks that can cause crashes and other issues. The following steps are required to add this feature:

1. File Paths That Need to Be Created or Modified: These file paths should be created or modified in a manner that they will not conflict with existing files.

2. Python Code Required: A brief snippet of the Python code required would be provided. This can include creating a file, running a script, etc.

3. Next Step Command: The 'Next Step' command should provide a clear and concise instruction for the user on how to implement or execute the necessary steps. This could be in the form of an `bash` or `Rust` command.
