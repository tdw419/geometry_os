# Solution for Task: Implement LRU cache for tile textures

[Task]

Title: Implementing a LRU Cache for Tile Texture Images

Context:

Change ID: add-pixi-improvement-daemon

Task:

The Geometry OS Implementation Agent (GAIA) is tasked with implementing a LRU Cache (Last Resort Updates) for tile texture images. The LRU Cache is a technique that ensures that the most frequently accessed tiles are updated first, thereby reducing memory usage and improving performance.

To achieve this, GAIA will need to create or modify the following file paths:

- `/usr/lib/gisengine/data/tiles/`
- `/usr/lib/gisengine/renderers/`

The GAIA team will also require a brief snippet of Python or Rust code that implements this feature. The code should be well-documented and easy to understand, with clear instructions for how to run it.

Next Steps:

1. Create file paths using the `mkdir` command in Linux.
2. Modify `/usr/lib/gisengine/data/tiles/` to contain the cache directory.
3. Modify `/usr/lib/gisengine/renderers/` to contain the cache directory.
4. Write Python or Rust code that implements LRU Cache in a way that is easy for GAIA to understand and modify. The code should be well-commented with explanations of each step.
5. Create or modify the necessary files within the `/usr/lib/gisengine` directory.
6. Write a brief instructional document that explains how to run the LRU Cache implementation, including any required dependencies or settings.
7. Test the LRU Cache implementation against the Geometry OS platform and ensure it works as intended.
8. Deploy the LRU Cache implementation on the Geometry OS platform.
9. Document the deployment process and any issues encountered.
10. Maintain and improve the LRU Cache implementation over time.
