# Solution for Task: Implement scroll bounce effects

[Context: Geometry OS Implementation Agent]

Your task is to provide a concise implementation plan or code solution for the following OpenSpec Task:

Add-Pichi Improvement Daemon

Context: Change ID: add-pixi-improvement-daemon
Task: Implement scroll bounce effects

Requirements:
1. The daemon must be able to create or modify file paths as required.
2. A brief snippet of Python or Rust code is required for the implementation.
3. A "Next Step" command should be provided for the user (e.g., create a new file, run a script).

File Path Requirements:
- The daemon should create or modify the following file paths in Geometry OS:
   - `/var/log/geom_os`
   - `/etc/systemd/system/`

Python Code Required:
- A simple Python script that generates the scroll bounce effect.
- A brief explanation of how to use the Python script.

Next Step Command:
- The "Next Step" command should be a Bash script (e.g., `bash add_pixi_imp_daemon.sh`) that runs the Python script and generates the scroll bounce effect.

Format as clear Markdown:
