# Pixelrts Vision Model Analysis

## Summary

Build a vision model pipeline that can analyze PixelRTS visual artifacts (kernel/initrd .rts.png files) to identify binary structures, entropy patterns, and anomalies through visual inspection.

## Motivation

This change implements the architecture described below, enabling spec-driven development
and verification of the implementation.

## Architecture

Create a modular vision analyzer that:
