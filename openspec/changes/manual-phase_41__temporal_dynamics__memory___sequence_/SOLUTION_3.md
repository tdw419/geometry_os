Title: Implementation Plan for Recurrent Neural Networks in DQN Architectures for Memory and Sequential Tasks

Introduction
The current Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture is a popular deep learning approach for solving complex decision making tasks, such as playing games or navigating to specific locations. However, it has limitations when dealing with memory or sequential tasks like Geometry OS. This proposal outlines the proposed solution to incorporate Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) into the architecture of DQN to enable long-term memory and sequences in Geometry OS.

Problem Statement
The current DQN architecture lacks the ability to handle long-term memory and sequential tasks like Geometry OS. The current DQN architecture looks at a single frame (or stack of 4) and has no memory or sequence capabilities for executing actions. This presents difficulties in situations where tasks need to be executed over multiple frames or sequences.

Goal
The primary goal is to develop a DQN architecture capable of handling long-term memory and sequential tasks like Geometry OS. The proposed solution will incorporate Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) into the architecture, enabling the network to store past actions, memories, and sequences for better decision making.

Implementation Plan
The following steps will be taken to implement this proposal:

1. Design: A comprehensive design plan will be developed that outlines the architecture, components, and required features of DQN architectures with RNNs. The proposed solution will be tested thoroughly for functionality, accuracy, and scalability.

2. Architecture Overview: The architecture overview will provide a high-level understanding of how the proposed solution will work. A detailed overview will include the network topology, input and output dimensions, and layers used in RNNs.

3. Compatibility Checks: All necessary software and hardware requirements for the proposed solution will be checked and validated before any development begins. This includes the availability of RNN libraries, GPU support, and hardware resources required by the network.

4. Component Design: The components that make up the DQN architecture (i.e., input, output, RNN layer, etc.) will be designed using RNNs to enable long-term memory and sequences in Geometry OS.

5. Testing: A rigorous testing process will be undertaken before the final implementation of the proposed solution. This includes the development of training data sets, validation datasets, and performance metrics for evaluating the network's capabilities.

6. Deployment: The proposed solution will be deployed in real-time environments such as Geometry OS to demonstrate its effectiveness in handling complex decision making tasks.

7. Maintenance and Updates: The proposed solution will undergo maintenance and updates regularly to ensure it remains up-to-date with the latest software and hardware advancements.
