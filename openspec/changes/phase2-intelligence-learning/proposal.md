# Phase2 Intelligence Learning

## Summary

Implement ML-based access prediction and automatic hot zone migration for Infinite Map OS, making it self-optimizing and intelligent

## Motivation

This change implements the architecture described below, enabling spec-driven development
and verification of the implementation.

## Architecture

Neural network-based access prediction + background migration daemon with automatic hot zone file relocation

## Tech Stack

TensorFlow/Keras for neural nets, Python asyncio for daemon, pytest for testing
