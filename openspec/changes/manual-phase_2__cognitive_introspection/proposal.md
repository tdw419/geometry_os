# Change: manual-phase_2__cognitive_introspection

## Problem Statement
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: The system needs to "see" itself to improve itself. We will build visualization and introspection tools that allow agents to query their own performance history.

## Proposed Solution
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 2: Cognitive Introspection

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Medium complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (automated implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- **Goal**: Phase 2: Cognitive Introspection

**Description**: The system needs to "see" itself to improve itself. We will build visualization and introspection tools that allow agents to query their own performance history.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Create `CTRMStatsViewer` to visualize decision confidence and repair rates
- Implement `PerformanceTelemetry` to track generation time and retry counts
- Create a "Self-Health" dashboard accessible via CLI
