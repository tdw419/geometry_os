# Design: manual-phase_2__cognitive_introspection

## Architecture Overview
Manual Implementation: Phase 2: Cognitive Introspection

## Component Design
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: The system needs to "see" itself to improve itself. We will build visualization and introspection tools that allow agents to query their own performance history.

## Implementation Plan
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 2: Cognitive Introspection

## Component Details
### **Goal**: Phase 2: Cognitive Introspection

**Description**: The system needs to "see" itself to improve itself. We will build visualization and introspection tools that allow agents to query their own performance history.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Create `CTRMStatsViewer` to visualize decision confidence and repair rates
- Implement `PerformanceTelemetry` to track generation time and retry counts
- Create a "Self-Health" dashboard accessible via CLI

- All requirements for 'Phase 2: Cognitive Introspection' are implemented and functional.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Acceptance tests based on success criteria

## Performance Considerations
- Estimated complexity: Medium
- Parallel execution where possible
- Resource optimization for autonomous execution
