# Design: manual-phase_1__analyze_and_fix

## Architecture Overview
Manual Implementation: Phase 1: Analyze and Fix

## Component Design
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: Analyze the root cause of the failures for: Parser. Implement the necessary code changes to fix the bugs. Validate the fixes by ensuring all tests pass.

## Implementation Plan
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 1: Analyze and Fix

## Component Details
### **Goal**: Phase 1: Analyze and Fix

**Description**: Analyze the root cause of the failures for: Parser. Implement the necessary code changes to fix the bugs. Validate the fixes by ensuring all tests pass.

**Key Deliverables**:
- **Objective 1: Resolve Test Failures**
- **Goal:** The following tests are failing: Parser. Analyze the code and logs, then create a roadmap to fix the issues.
- **Tasks:**

- All requirements for 'Phase 1: Analyze and Fix' are implemented and functional.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Acceptance tests based on success criteria

## Performance Considerations
- Estimated complexity: Medium
- Parallel execution where possible
- Resource optimization for autonomous execution
