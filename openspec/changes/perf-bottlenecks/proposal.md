# Proposal: perf-bottlenecks

Area: Performance

Description:
The visual shell implementation is currently missing performance bottlenecks, which can significantly impact the overall system performance. This proposal aims to address this gap by improving the performance of the visual shell.

Problem Statement:
The visual shell is critical for delivering high-quality graphics in real time, but it has been plagued by poor performance in recent releases. This has resulted in slower speeds and reduced user experience, leading to negative feedback from customers and a decline in revenue.

Proposed Solution:
To address this problem, we propose the following solution:

1. Performance Profiling: The visual shell will be profiled using tools such as Performance Monitoring Tools and Visual Studio Profiler. This will enable us to identify bottlenecks in the system and optimize them for better performance.

2. Optimized Memory Allocation: To reduce memory usage, we propose using a new optimization technique called Virtualization. This allows for the use of shared virtual memory between different processes, reducing the need for physical memory allocations and improving overall system performance.

3. Thread Management: We will improve the thread management by implementing more efficient thread scheduling algorithms to ensure that threads are allocated in a way that minimizes latency.

4. Graphics Rendering Optimization: To reduce graphical rendering time, we propose using a graphics processing unit (GPU) to accelerate some of the rendering tasks. This will improve overall system performance and reduce the strain on the CPU.

Benefits:
1. Improved Performance: The proposed solution will result in improved system performance, resulting in faster loading times for multimedia content and a more enjoyable user experience.

2. Reduced System Burden: By reducing graphics rendering time, we can free up processor cycles for other tasks, allowing the system to run more efficiently without sacrificing performance.

3. Increased Flexibility: With improved graphics rendering performance, users will have a higher level of satisfaction with the visual shell and be more likely to return to the platform.

4. Improved Customer Satisfaction: By providing faster, more responsive systems, we can improve customer retention rates and increase their loyalty to our platform.

Risks:
1. High Cost: Implementing a new performance optimization technique may come with an initial cost, which could negatively impact the company's bottom line.

2. Re-engineering Project: There is a risk that the proposed solution may require significant re-engineering efforts to achieve optimal performance, leading to additional costs and delays in delivery.

Timeframe:
The implementation of the proposed solution will take approximately 4 months. The project timeline is as follows:

Month 1 - Definition of Requirements (DOR)
Month 2 - Design and Prototyping
Month 3 - Implementation and Testing
Month 4 - Integration with Operating System
Month 5 - Deployment

Conclusion:
This proposal addresses a critical gap in the visual shell performance by proposing a series of performance optimization techniques. By implementing these solutions, we can improve system performance, reduce latency, and provide a more enjoyable user experience for our customers. The proposed solution has the potential to improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue, and lower operating costs.
