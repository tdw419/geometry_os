- [x] Task 1: Create a list of specific and actionable tasks based on the proposed solution. - [x] Subtask 1.1: Implement the performance profiling tool by using tools such as Performance Monitoring Tools (PMT) and Visual Studio Profile to identify bottlenecks in the system. This will involve gathering data about system behavior, identifying areas where there may be performance issues, and creating a detailed analysis of the code. - [x] Subtask 1.2: Optimize memory allocation by using a new optimization technique called Virtualiaton (VT). This involves setting up and managing virtual machines on our computer to improve overall system performance. - [x] Task 2: Implement thread management using a hybrid approach that combines CPU-based prioritization and memory-based prioritization. This will involve creating threads with different priorities based on their urgency and available resources, as well as implementing a process scheduler to ensure that the most important threads run first. - [x] Task 3: Implement image processing using an optimized image format such as JPEG or PNG instead of bitmap images. This will involve converting high-resolution images to more efficient formats that can have lower performance when rendered at higher resolutions. - [x] Test and document the proposed solution. - [x] Estimate the time required for each task based on the tools and resources provided.
