# Specification: ouroboro

[ouroboro]

Component Purpose:
Ouroboro is designed to provide efficient and reliable performance in a range of applications that require high accuracy, repeatability, and reliability. Ouroboro's primary purpose is to meet the needs of industrial automation systems, such as robotics, vision systems, and assembly lines.

Interface Definition:
Ouroboro's interface is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different applications. It supports a range of input/output protocols, including USB, CANopen, and EtherCAT. Ouroboro also includes built-in error detection and correction mechanisms that can detect and correct errors that might occur during operation.

Behavior Specification:
Ouroboro's behavior specification is designed to ensure that it performs consistently and reliably in a wide range of conditions. This includes factors such as power supply, temperature, humidity, and vibration. Ouroboro is designed to be highly reliable, with a maximum failure rate of less than 1% over its expected lifetime.

Performance Requirements:
Ouroboro must meet the following performance requirements in order to fulfill its purpose:
- Accuracy: Ouroboro must be able to measure and control the position, velocity, and angle of an object with a high degree of accuracy.
- Reliability: Ouroboro must be reliable enough to handle high levels of wear and tear without failures or downtime.
- Efficiency: Ouroboro must be as efficient as possible while maintaining high performance standards.

Error Handling:
Ouroboro includes built-in error detection and correction mechanisms that can detect and correct errors that might occur during operation. In the event of an error, ouroboro will automatically restart itself or re-enable the affected subsystem(s) to resume normal operation as soon as possible.
