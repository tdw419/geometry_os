# Design: improve-hardware-configurations

Area: Performance (Architecture and Hardware)

Description:
The performance of our software application has been severely impacted by certain hardware configurations, leading to slow load times or crashes in some environments. This has resulted in a decrease in user satisfaction, which we believe is due to the reliability and functionality of the system. As such, we propose an improvement strategy that will optimize the system's architecture and hardware configuration for better performance.

Problem Statement:
The following hardware configurations have been identified as affecting our software application's performance:
- Dual-core CPUs with 2GB RAM or less
- Low-end graphics cards (e.g., Intel HD Graphics 4000)
- Older operating systems (e.g., Windows Vista or lower)
- Slow internet connections

Benefits:
Optimizing the system's architecture and hardware configuration will result in better performance by:
- Improving overall system stability and reliability
- Enhancing system speed and responsiveness
- Reducing energy consumption and cost for maintenance

Risk:
The proposed optimization strategy involves significant changes to the existing system, which can have potential risks such as increased complexity or unexpcted performance drop. Additionally, it may require hardware upgrade(s) that are beyond our budget. Nevertheless, we believe that the benefits outweigh the risk and would like to address them by providing an estimation of time, cost, and resources required for the proposed optimization strategy.

Timeframe:
The proposed optimization strategy will be implemented over a period of 3 months. The timeline is as follows:
- Month 1 (Start): Review hardware configuration and identify areas to optimize.
- Month 2 (Start): Develop optimized software architecture and hardware configurations, including drivers and firmware updates.
- Month 3 (End): Test the optimized system on various hardware configurations and gather feedback from users.

Cost:
The proposed optimization strategy will require the following resources:
- Software developers
- Hardware engineers
- Architects
- Programmers
- Quality assurance team

We estimate that these resources will cost between $50,000 to $75,000 over the 3-month period. This includes time for software development, hardware engineering, testing, and documentation. The proposed optimization strategy also involves third-party software and hardware upgrades as necessary.

To estimate the total cost of the proposed optimization strategy, we will conduct a financial analysis using the following assumptions:
- Software development costs: $20,000 per developer per month ($150,000 per year)
- Hardware engineering costs: $5,000 per engineer per month ($45,000 per year)
- Testing and bug fixing costs: $2,500 per user test case per month (8 hours per week)
- Documentation costs: $1,000 per user manual per month ($36,000 per year)
- Third-party software and hardware upgrades: $4,000 per software package upgrade ($24,000 per year)
- Cost of hardware upgrades (e.g., RAM, storage, network): $1,500 per upgrade ($9,000 per year)

Overall, the proposed optimization strategy will cost a total of $60,000 to $80,000 over 3 months. This is based on our estimated resources and time frame. We estimate that this cost can be covered by our budget if it meets our projected user satisfaction metrics, such as improved performance and reduced energy consumption.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, we propose an optimization strategy to improve the performance of our software application using a hardware configuration overhaul. This strategy will result in better system stability and responsiveness, as well as reducing energy consumption and cost for maintenance. We estimate that this cost can be covered by our budget if it meets user satisfaction metrics, such as improved performance and reduced energy consumption. However, we also acknowledge the potential risks associated with hardware upgrades beyond our budget, so we will provide an estimation of time, costs, and resources required to mitigate these risks.
