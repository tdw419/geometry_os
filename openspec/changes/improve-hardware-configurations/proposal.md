# Proposal: improve-hardware-configurations

Area: Performance (Architecture and Hardware)

Description:
The performance of our software application has been severely impacted by certain hardware configurations, leading to slow load times or crashes in some environments. This has resulted in a decrease in user satisfaction, which we believe is due to the reliability and functionality of the system. As such, we propose an improvement strategy that will optimize the system's architecture and hardware configuration for better performance.

Problem Statement:
The performance of our software application has been affected by various hardware configurations, including but not limited to:
- Dual-core CPUs with 2GB RAM or less
- Low-end graphics cards (e.g., Intel HD Graphics 4000)
- Older operating systems (e.g., Windows Vista or lower)
- Slow internet connections

Benefits:
Optimizing the system's architecture and hardware configuration will result in better performance by:
- Improving overall system stability and reliability
- Enhancing system speed and responsiveness
- Reducing energy consumption and cost for maintenance

Risks:
The proposed optimization strategy involves significant changes to the existing system, which can have potential risks such as increased complexity or unexpected performance drop. Additionally, it may require hardware upgrades that are beyond our budget. Nevertheless, we believe that the benefits outweigh the risks and would like to address them by providing an estimation of time, cost, and resources required for the proposed optimization strategy.

Timeframe:
The proposed optimization strategy will be implemented over a period of 3 months. The timeline is as follows:
- Month 1 (Start): Review hardware configuration and identify areas to optimize.
- Month 2 (Start): Develop optimized software architecture and hardware configurations, including drivers and firmware updates.
- Month 3 (End): Test the optimized system on various hardware configurations and gather feedback from users.

Cost:
The estimated cost of this optimization strategy is $50,000. This includes hardware upgrades, driver and firmware updates, as well as development costs for testing and monitoring. However, we understand that some resources may be required to complete the optimization process, such as additional personnel or external vendors.

Resources:
To optimize the system's architecture and hardware configuration for better performance, we will require the following resources:
- Hardware Engineer (3 months)
- Software Developers (6 months)
- Hardware Test Engineers (4 months)
- Maintenance Engineers (2 months)
- Costumer Support Specialists (1 month)

Conclusion:
Optimizing the system's architecture and hardware configuration will result in better performance by improving stability, reliability, speed, and energy efficiency. By addressing our software application's performance issues, we can provide a more efficient, reliable, and satisfying user experience. We appreciate your consideration of this proposal and look forward to a successful collaboration. Thank you for considering our request.
