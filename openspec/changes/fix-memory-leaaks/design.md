# Performance Gaap in Visual Shell Core

The Geometry OS operating system lacks essential features that can improve its performance, leading to poor user experience and decreased productivity. The following areas are affected:

1. Network Connectivity: VSCPL lacks a robust and efficient network stack that ensures high-speed data transfer and smooth network connectivity. This causes latency issues, which leads to slow application responses and intermittent connection drop in applications. As a result, users experience reduced productivity due to laggy applications.

2. File Management: VSCPL lacks an efficient system monitoring feature that can alert users of critical system issues. If there are errors or system failure, it takes longer for the system to recover, leading to increased downtime and reduced productivity.

3. System Monitoring: The VSCPL lacks a robust system monitoring feature that can alert users of critical system issues. If there are errors or system failure, it takes longer for the system to recover, leading to increased downtime and reduced productivity.

Benefits:
Improved performance in the following ways:
1. Improved File Management: The VSCPL will have a robust file management system that can efficiently manage large files. This reduces the time required for opening multiple files simultaneously, speeding up application launch times.
2. Better Network Connectivity: The VSCPL will have a more efficient network stack, resulting in faster data transfer and smoother network connectivity. This leads to improved productivity as users spend less time waiting for context or applications to load.
3. Improved System Monitoring: The VSCPL will have a robust system monitoring feature that can alert users of critical system issues. This reduces the risk of downtime and delays in recovering from system failures, leading to increased productivity.
