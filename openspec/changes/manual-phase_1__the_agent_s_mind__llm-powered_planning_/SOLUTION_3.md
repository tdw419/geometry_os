# Solution for Task: **Task 1**: **Goal**: Phase 1: The Agent's Mind (LLM-Powered Planning)

The following is an architectural overview of the proposed solution to implement manual implementation of phase 1: The Agent's Mind (LLM-Powered Planning) using LLVM's LLVM IR. The proposed solution follows a clear and concise design with defined components, tasks, and dependencies.

Architecture Overview:
The proposed solution is an implementation of a manual implementation of phase 1: The Agent's Mind (LLM-Powered Planning) using LLVM's LLVM IR. It consists of the following components:

1. **Goal**: Phase 1: The Agent's Mind (LLM-Powered Planning)
The prompt will instruct the LLM to act as a software engineer and return a JSON object representing a list of actions. Each action will have a `tool_name` (e.g., `read_file`, `replace`) and `parameters`. Modify `_plan_actions` to call the LLVM engine, parse the returned JSON, and return the structured list of actions.

2. **Impact Assessment**: Medium complexity with medium risk due to automated implementation.

3. **Success Criteria**: Goal is to implement manual implementation of phase 1: The Agent's Mind (LLM-Powered Planning) using LLVM IR.

Component Design:
The proposed solution consists of the following components:

1. **Goal**: Phase 1: The Agent's Mind (LLM-Powered Planning)
Components:
   - `_plan_actions` function: This function will call the LLVM engine to parse the returned JSON, and return the structured list of actions. It takes in two parameters: `json_str` containing the parsed JSON string and a callback function that returns the LLVM IR code to be executed.
   - `_create_file_action` function: This function will create an LLVM IR file from a Python or Rust script, which can be used to execute LLVM IR directly in LLVM. It takes in two parameters: `script_str`, containing the Python/Rust code to generate the LLVM IR file, and a callback function that returns the LLVM IR code.
   - `_run_script_action` function: This function will run an LLVM IR script generated by `create_file_action`. It takes in one parameter: `script_str`, containing the LLVM IR script to execute.

2. **Impact Assessment**: Medium complexity with low risk due to automated implementation.

3. **Success Criteria**: Goal is to implement manual implementation of phase 1: The Agent's Mind (LLM-Powered Planning) using LLVM IR.

Design Overview:
The proposed solution follows the LLVM design philosophy, which prioritizes simplicity and efficiency over feature complexity. It uses LLVM IR as the programming model to create an automated implementation of manual tasks. The design also considers the impact on performance and scalability by optimizing for efficiency.

Component Details:
- `_plan_actions` function: This function will call the LLVM engine to parse the returned JSON, and return the structured list of actions. It takes in two parameters: `json_str` containing the parsed JSON string and a callback function that returns the LLVM IR code to be executed.
   - The LLVM IR code will be generated directly from the Python/Rust script using the `_create_file_action` function, which will create an LLVM IR file from a Python or Rust script.
- `_create_file_action` function: This function will create an LLVM IR file from a Python or Rust script, which can be used to execute LLVM IR directly in LLVM. It takes in two parameters: `script_str`, containing the Python/Rust code to generate the LLVM IR file, and a callback function that returns the LLVM IR code.
   - This function generates LLVM IR based on the given script string using the `llvm-ir` package in LLVM. It also supports customizing LLVM IR generation parameters, such as optimizations and passes.
- `_run_script_action` function: This function will run an LLVM IR script generated by `create_file_action`. It takes in one parameter: `script_str`, containing the LLVM IR script to execute.
   - This function executes the LLVM IR script using the `llvm-mc` package in LLVM, which provides a simple interface for executing LLVM IR. It also supports customizing LLVM IR generation parameters, such as optimizations and passes.

Competencies:
The proposed solution is designed to be scalable and efficient while maintaining simplicity. The following competencies are considered in the implementation design:
   - Scalability: The proposed solution can handle large and complex data sets without any performance degradation due to LLVM IR parsing.
   - Efficiency: The proposed solution prioritizes simplicity, efficiency, and memory usage over feature complexity to achieve an optimal balance between performance and usability.
   - Compatibility: The proposed solution is compatible with Python/Rust scripts and can be used on both Linux and macOS platforms.

Testing:
The proposed solution will undergo unit testing to ensure that the components are working as expected, and integration tests to verify that the system can execute LLVM IR generated by `create_file_action`.
