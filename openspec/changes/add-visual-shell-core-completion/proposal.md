# Geometry OS Proposal for Incomplete Visual Shell Core Implementation

## Problem Statement

The current implementation of the visual shell core in Geometry OS is incomplete. This leaves several critical features unimplemented or partially implemented, resulting in a suboptimal user experience and limiting the functionality that can be offered to users. The incomplete nature of the implementation also makes it difficult for developers to contribute to the project, as they are unsure about the expected behavior and available interfaces.

## Proposed Solution

To address this issue, we propose a comprehensive overhaul of the visual shell core. This will involve:

1. **Architecture Refinement**: Revising and refining the architecture to ensure that all necessary components are included and properly integrated.
2. **Feature Implementation**: Completing the implementation of all planned features, including but not limited to window management, theming, and user interface elements.
3. **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation for the visual shell core, including API specifications, usage examples, and best practices.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Implementing a robust testing framework to ensure that all components work correctly together and that the system behaves as expected under various conditions.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced User Experience**: A complete and well-implemented visual shell core will provide users with a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **Improved Developer Productivity**: Clear documentation and a fully functional implementation will make it easier for developers to contribute to the project, leading to faster development cycles and improved quality of contributions.
- **Stability and Reliability**: A thoroughly tested system is less likely to experience crashes or unexpected behavior, improving the overall stability and reliability of Geometry OS.

## Risks

- **Resource Intensive**: The overhaul may require significant resources in terms of time and manpower. It could also introduce new bugs if not carefully managed.
- **Complexity**: Refining an existing architecture and implementing new features can increase complexity, making it harder to maintain the system in the long term.
- **User Disruption**: If the changes are not communicated effectively, users may experience difficulties with their workflows, leading to frustration and decreased productivity.

## Timeline Estimate

Given the magnitude of the proposed work, we estimate a timeline of 3-4 months for the following phases:

1. **Architecture Refinement (2 weeks)**
2. **Feature Implementation (6 weeks)**
3. **Documentation (2 weeks)**
4. **Testing and Validation (2 weeks)**

Additional time may be required for final review, bug fixing, and user training.

## Conclusion

The proposed solution to the incomplete visual shell core implementation in Geometry OS is essential for enhancing the user experience and improving developer productivity. While there are potential risks associated with this effort, the benefits outweigh these risks. By implementing a thorough overhaul of the visual shell core, we can ensure that Geometry OS remains a robust and reliable platform for users.
