# Solution for Task: **Task 1**: **Goal**: Phase 2: The Implementer (Autonomous Agent)

[Geometry OS Implementation Agent]

Goal: To provide a concise and executable plan or code solution for implementing Phase 2 of the OpenSpec task for Geometry OS.

Context:
Change ID: manual-phase_2__the_implementer__autoonomous_agent_
Task: Goal: Phase 2: The Implementer (Autonomous Agent)

Problem Statement: Manual implementation of roadmap phase: Create `systems/evolution/implementation_agent.py`. It will have a core loop:
1. Parse the first pending task from tasks.md and analyze & plan file edits, such as replace and read.
2. Execute the planned file changes using an LLM call to break natural languaire.
3. Verify the results of the test suite.
4. Loop/finish if tests pass, marking the task as complete and moving on to the next. If they fail, try a different approach.
5. Programmatically access subset of tools required for this phase (read_file, replace, run_shell_command) by providing a brief snippet of code or syntax.

Solution:
1. Read Task: Parse the first pending task from tasks.md and analyze & plan file edits using an LLM call to break natural languaire.
2. Analyze & Plan: Use an LLM call to break the natural languaire task into specific file edit commands (`read`, `replace`).
3. Execute Edit Commands: Apply the planned file changes.
4. Verify Results of Tests: Run the test suite and check if the results are as expected (e.g. File opened, contents updated).
5. Loop/Finish: If tests pass, mark the task as complete and move on to the next phase.
If they fail, try a different approach.

Impact Assessment:
- Medium complexity due to needing access to subset of tools required for this phase (read_file, replace, run_shell_command)
- Impact may be lessened with automated scripting and/or programmatic access to these tools.

Competencies:
1. Read Task (analyze & plan file edits)
2. Analyze & Plan (verify results of test suite)
3. Execute Edit Commands (apply planned file changes)
4. Verify Results of Tests (check if results are as expected)
5. Loop/Finish (if tests pass, mark task as complete and move on to next phase)
If tests fail, try a different approach (e.g. Debug code).
