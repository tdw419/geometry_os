# Autonomous Os Management

## Summary

Extend the AI Project Management system to autonomously manage the large-scale development of Geometry OS, applying the four pillars: Structural Quantification, Spatial Intelligence, Dynamic Memory Neuromodulation, and Multi-Agent Orchestration.

## Motivation

This change implements the architecture described below, enabling spec-driven development
and verification of the implementation.

## Architecture

Modular enhancement of existing AI PM with new specialized agents, spatial code indexing, metrics collection, and formal verification integration.

## Tech Stack

Python 3, Rust (for Geometry OS), Hilbert curve indexing, pytest, existing LLM bridges
