# Proposal: fix-mem_leak_during_objective_5

Proposal for Gap: Area: Performance

Area: Performance
Description: Add a feature that improves the performance of the system
Priority: High
Affected Components: Daemon

The proposed solution to the gap in the area: Performance is to add a new feature to improve the performance of Geometry OS. The new feature will be designed to optimize the CPU usage, reduce the load on the system and eliminate bottlenecks that may lead to slowdowns.

Benefits:
- Improved performance: This new feature will allow users to run complex operations with ease, improving the overall user experience.
- Reduced load on CPU: By optimizing the CPU usage, this feature will reduce the stress placed on the system and help prevent overheating.
- Enhance system stability: With fewer resources used by the CPU, the OS should run more stable, resulting in a less stressful environment for users.
- Eliminate bottlenecks: By optimizing resource usage, this feature will ensure that the most critical operations are handled efficiently, freeing up resources to handle other tasks.

Risks:
- System downtime: This new feature may require some maintenance or configuration work, which could lead to system downtime. However, with regular backups and monitoring, these risks should be minimized.
- Performance degradation: While this new feature is designed to optimize the CPU usage, it may result in reduced performance during peak periods. This can cause frustration for users who rely on the system for work or leisure activities.

Timeframe:
- Development and testing: 3 months
- Release: After 6 months

Solution:
The new feature will be implemented as a daemon that runs in the background, managing resource usage and providing real-time performance reports. The daemon will be designed to communicate with the system's core components, such as the kernel and software libraries, to optimize CPU usage and reduce load on the system. This daemon will also provide users with real-time information about their system's performance, enabling them to make informed decisions about resource allocation.

Cost:
The development and testing of this new feature will require a significant investment in resources, including software development and maintenance costs. However, the benefits of improved performance and reduced load on the system should outweigh these costs over time.

Conclusion:
The proposed solution to the gap in the area: Performance is a crucial aspect for Geometry OS users, which has led to an increase in requests for performance optimization. This new feature will enhance the system's performance by optimizing resource usage and reducing load on the CPU, while minimizing downtime during maintenance or configuration work. The proposed solution is expected to bring significant benefits to the user base, including improved performance, reduced load on the system, and enhanced system stability.
