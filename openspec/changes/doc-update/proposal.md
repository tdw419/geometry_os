# Proposal: doc-update

Proposal for Area: Documentation

Description:
The documentation of the visual shell implementation needs to be updated with clear and concise explanation of its functionality. This will ensure that users can easily understand how the system works and how to use it efficiently. The proposed solution involves updating the existing documentation, which will be addressed in this proposal.

Problem Statement:
One of the significant issues faced by users is a lack of clarity on the functionalities provided by the visual shell implementation. This leads to confusion when users try to use the system and makes it difficult for them to understand how the system works. The proposed solution aims to provide clear and concise documentation that explains each functionality, step-by-step, in detail.

Proposed Solution:
To address this issue, we propose the following approach:

1. Develop a comprehensive documentation outline that outlines all the functionalities provided by the visual shell implementation. This will serve as a guide for users to understand how the system works and use it efficiently.
2. Conduct user research to gather feedback on the existing documentation and identify areas for improvement. Based on this feedback, we will revise the existing documentation accordingly.
3. Develop and implement a new version of the documentation that is easy to read and understand. We will ensure that each section is organized logically and visually appealing.
4. Continuously update the documentation as necessary based on user feedback and changes in the system's functionality.
5. Develop training materials for users, such as tutorials and video demos, that are designed to help them learn how to use the visual shell implementation efficiently.

Benefits:
1. Improved user experience: The updated documentation will provide clear and concise explanations of each functionality, making it easier for users to understand how to use the system.
2. Increased productivity: Users will have a better understanding of how to use the visual shell implementation, leading to increased productivity and efficiency.
3. Reduced support requests: Users will be able to easily find answers to their questions, reducing the need for frequent support requests.
4. Improved reliability: By providing clear documentation, users will have a better understanding of how to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
5. Increased customer satisfaction: By providing high-quality documentation, customers will be more likely to recommend and use the visual shell implementation.

Risks:
1. Time constraint: Developing the new documentation may require additional time than expected, which could affect timelines for other projects or product development.
2. Budget constraints: There may be a limit to the resources available to develop the new documentation, making it difficult to complete all of the requirements.

Timeframe:
1. Project planning and scoping: 3 months
2. Documentation development: 6 months
3. Training materials development: 4 months

Scope of work:
1. Develop a comprehensive documentation outline that outlines all the functionalities provided by the visual shell implementation.
2. Conduct user research to gather feedback on the existing documentation and identify areas for improvement. Based on this feedback, revise the existing documentation accordingly.
3. Develop and implement a new version of the documentation that is easy to read and understand.
4. Continuously update the documentation as necessary based on user feedback and changes in the system's functionality.
5. Develop training materials for users, such as tutorials and video demos, that are designed to help them learn how to use the visual shell implementation efficiently.

Cost:
1. Project planning and scoping: $20k
2. Documentation development: $30k
3. Training materials development: $5k

Conclusion:
In conclusion, updating the existing documentation with clear and concise explanation of each functionality will provide users with a better understanding of how to use the visual shell implementation efficiently. This, in turn, will lead to improved user experience, increased productivity, reduced support requests, improved reliability, and increased customer satisfaction. The proposed approach is structured, comprehensive, and timely, while considering budget constraints and user needs.
