# Design: doc-update

Introduction:
The proposed technical design for the documentation of the visual shell implementation aims to update and improve its existing documentation, ensuring that users can easily understand and use it efficiently. The primary objective of this proposal is to provide clear and concise documentation that explains each functionality, step-by-step, in detail. This will help users to better understand how the system works and utilize it more effectively.

Problem Statement:
One of the significant issues faced by users when using the visual shell implementation is a lack of clarity on the functionalities provided by this software. This leads to confusion when users try to use the system, making it difficult for them to understand how to use it efficiently. The proposed solution aims to provide clear and concise documentation that explains each functionality, step-by-step, in detail, ensuring that users can better understand how the system works and utilize it efficiently.

Proposed Solution:
To address this issue, we propose developing an updated version of the documentation outline that is easy to read and understaned. We will conduct user research to gather feedback on the existing documentation and identify areas for improvement. Based on this feedback, we will revise the existing documentation accordingly, ensuring that each section is organized logically and visually appealing.

We plan to develop and implement a new version of the documentation that is easy to read and understand. We will ensure that each section is organized logically and visually appealing. We will also create training materials for users, such as tutorials and video demos, designed to help them learn how to use the software efficiently.

Benefits:
1. Improved user experience: The updated documentation will provide clear and concise explanation of each functionality, making it easier for users to understand how to use the system. This will improve their productivity by reducing confusion and misinterpretation of the software.
2. Increased productivity: By having a more comprehensive understanding of how the system works, users will be better equipped to use it efficiently. They will have a clearer picture of the features and functionalities available in the software, making them less likely to encounter errors or unexpected behavior.
3. Improved communication: By providing clear documentation for the user, users can communicate more effectively with other team members or stakeholders when implementing and using the system. They will be better equipped to address any questions or issues that arise during implementation or use of the software.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, we propose updating the existing documentation outline with clear and concise explanation of each functionality in detail. We also plan to develop and implement training materials for users, such as tutorials and video demos, designed to help them learn how to use the software efficiently. This proposal aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the system's functionalities and increase productivity for users through improved communication.
