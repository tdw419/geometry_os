# Neural Heatmap Phase 2 1 1 Performance

## Summary

Ensure production-grade performance and reliability through comprehensive benchmarking, cross-browser compatibility, and real-world integration testing.

## Motivation

This change implements the architecture described below, enabling spec-driven development
and verification of the implementation.

## Architecture

Add performance monitoring instrumentation, optimize render pipelines with viewport culling and object pooling, implement graceful degradation for older browsers, and establish automated testing infrastructure.

## Tech Stack

Performance API (browser), WebGL/WebGPU fallback layers, PIXI.js v8 optimization, Node.js for stress testing, WebSocket for LM Studio integration
