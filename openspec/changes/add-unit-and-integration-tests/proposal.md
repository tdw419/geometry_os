# Proposal: add-unit-and-integration-tests

Area: Testing

Description:
The current unit and integration (UIT) tests of our application are not comprehensive enough to ensure its reliability and robustness. This can lead to unintended side effects and bugs in the system, which could result in significant downtime and customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the quality of these tests to address this gap.

Problem Statement:
Our application has a complex set of UITs that test the functionality of various components, including user interfaces (UI), data validation, and security checks. These tests ensure that our system works as intended, but they are not comprehensive enough to detect potential errors or issues. For instance, some UITs may only test the functionality of a single component while ignoring other important components or processes.

Prioritization:
The impact of this gap is significant, and its resolution will have an immediate impact on the success of our application. Therefore, it requires immediate attention and priority.

Affected Compponents:
Our application relies heavily on external third-party libraries, which we use to provide specific functionality and features. These dependencies can cause issues when testing, especially with the current UITs. For instance, some third-party libraries may have bugs or performance issues that could affect our system's stability and reliability.

Benefits:
Improved Testing Quality:
A comprehensive UIT test suite will ensure that the system's functionality is tested thoroughly to identify potential errors and defects before they are deployed. This approach will not only enhance the reliability and robustness of our application but also improve customer satisfaction, which could result in increased revenue.

Risks:
Longer Testing Cycle:
Improved testing quality requires more time and resources to conduct comprehensive tests. However, the benefits of improved reliability and robustness far outweigh any potential risks. A longer testing cycle may also lead to increased costs, which could be a major challenge for our budget.

Timeframe:
The proposed solution involves an initial 6-month timeframe for conducting comprehensive UIT tests that will cover all components and processes of the application. This time frame is sufficient enough to identify potential errors or defects before deployment.

Conclusion:
Improved Testing Quality is a crucial step in addressing the gap identified above. It can lead to significant improvements in the reliability, robustness, and customer satisfaction of our application. We recommend conducting comprehensive UIT tests for all components and processes of our system, with an initial focus on UI and data validation tests. The proposed solution outlined will ensure that we meet these goals within the 6-month timeframe.
