# Design: add-unit-and-integration-tests

Area: Testing

Description:
The current unit and integration (UIT) tests of our application are not comprehensive enough to ensure its reliability and robustness, posing a significant risk to the application's success. This proposal aims to improve testing quality by conducting comprehensive UIT tests that test the functionality of various components, including user interfaces (UI), data validation, and security checks. The proposed approach will enhance reliability, reduce defects, and improve customer satisfaction, resulting in increased revenues.

Problem Statement:
Our application has a complex set of UI tests that test functionality of various components, including user interfaces (UI), data validation, and security checks. These tests ensure that our system works as intended, but they are not comprehensive enough to detect potential errors or issues. For instance, some UI tests may only test the functionality of a single component while ignoring other important components or processes.

Principal Benefits:
A comprehensive UIT test suite will result in better testing quality, leading to improved reliability and robustness. The following benefits are expected as a result of this proposal:

1. Improved Testing Quality:
Conducting comprehensive UI tests ensures that the system's functionality is tested thoroughly to identify potential errors and defects before they are deployed. This approach will not only enhance reliability but also improve customer satisfaction, resulting in increased revenues.

2. Reduced Risk:
Longer testing cycles are often associated with more risk, especially when the quality of tests is not up to par. However, a longer testing cycle for comprehensive UIT tests will result in reduced risk since it will take longer but ensure better testing quality.

3. Enhanced Data Structure:
Improved data structure ensures that data validation checks are performed correctly, resulting in fewer errors and increased reliability.

4. Improved Security Checks:
Security checks are crucial to protect our application from malicious activities. Conducting comprehensive UIT tests will ensure that security checks are tested thoroughly, leading to improved security and reducing the risk of data breaches.

Risks:
The proposed approach has potential risks, including increased testing time and resources required. However, the benefits outweigh any potential risks in terms of improved reliability, reduced defects, and improved customer satisfaction resulting from a better-quality testing suite.

Introduction
Our application is a web-based platform that enables users to create and manage personal finance accounts. This project involves the development of unit tests for various components, including user interfaces (UI), data validation, and security checks. The proposed approach will enhance the quality of these tests by conducting comprehensive UI testing and reducing the risk associated with longer testing cycles.

Problem Statement:
Our application has a complex set of UITs that test the functionality of various components, including user interfaces (UI), data validation, and security checks. These tests ensure that our system works as intended, but they are not comprehensive enough to detect potential errors or issues. For instance, some UITs may only test the functionality of a single component while ignoring other important components or processes.

Prioritization:
The impact of this gap is significant, and its resolution will have an immediate impact on the success of our application. Therefore, it requires immediate attenton and priority.

Affected Compponents:
Our application relies heavily on external third-party libraries, which we use to provide specific functionality and features. These dependencies can cause issues when testing, especially with the current UITs. For instance, some third-party libariets may have bugs or performance issues that could affect our system's stability and reliability.

Benefits:
Improved Testing Quality:
A comprehensive UIT test suite will ensure that the system's functionality is tested thoroughly to identify potential errors and defects before they are deployed. This approach will not only enhance the reliability and robustness of our application but also improve customer satisfaction, which could result in increased revenues.

Risk Reduction:
The proposed approach will reduce the risk associated with long testing cycles by conducting comprehensive UIT tests. This approach will allow us to identify potential issues earlier in the development process, allowing for more efficient debugging and troubleshooting.

Risks Mitigation:
The proposed approach will mitigate risks by ensuring that all critical components are tested thoroughly. For instance, if a critical component fails during testing, we can immediately switch to another component until the issue is resolved.

Implementation:
The implementation of this proposal involves conducting comprehensive UIT testing for various components, including user interfaces (UI), data validation, and security checks. The approach will use unit tests, which are designed to test single functionalities or units of code. This approach will reduce the risk associated with long testing cycles by conducting comprehensive UIT tests.

Conclusion:
The proposed approach for improving our application's UIT quality is comprehensive and will improve the reliability and robustness of our system. The implementation of this proposal will lead to better customer satisfaction, resulting from the reduction in risk associated with long testing cycles.
