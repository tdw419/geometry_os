# Solution for Task: Create OpenSpec filesystem watcher for change detection

The Self-Improvving Workflow System will have four main components: an external systems component, an orchestrator component (OpenSpec), an analysis engine component (LM Studio AI Bridge), and feedback loop component (FM), each working together to create a recursive improvement loop. The system will integrate OpenSpec proposals/reviews into MCP orchestras through question-answering capabilities of LM Studio, automated updates of documents based on insight gained from AI agents, and feedback loops for continuous improvement.

The workflow orchestrator component (WO) will be a main controller for the system that manages the feedback loop component (FL), while the analysis engine component (QR) will analyze proposals/reviews and provide feedback to the FL component for further discussion or revisions. The feedback loop component (FL) will use a variety of tools, such as open-source feedback loops like Jupyter Notebooks or GitHub issues, to facilitate continuous improvement and allow AI agents to ask questions and get answers through MCP.

The system's design will enable self-improvement by integrating OpenSpec cycles with MCP orchestration and LM Studio AI capabilities in a recursive improvement loop. The workflow integration component (WO) will coordinate specification development with AI assistance, enabling the use of LM Studio for analysis, suggestions, and document updates. Question-answering capabilities provided by LM Studio will allow AI agents to query MCP orchestrators and provide feedback on documents.

The Self-Improvving Workflow System will be designed with a modular architecture, allowing for flexibility and scalability as needed. The system's four main components will work together in an iterative, recursive manner, creating continuous improvement through feedback loops. The self-improvement process can also be customized by users to fit specific workflow needs.

Overall, the Self-Improvving Workflow System will provide a unified workflow for OpenSpec proposals/reviews, MCP orchestration, LM Studio AI assistance, and feedback loops for continuous improvement.
