# Solution for Task: Implement QuestionRouter for MCP protocol question handling

--- Implementation ---
1. Define a new component within OpenSpec - **QuestionRouter**. This component should be designed to handle questions and provide feedback to the user. It should have a set of predefined question templates, as well as the ability to add new questions through a customizable template builder.
2. Integrate QuestionRouter with MCP orchestration by using the `MCPEngine` class provided by LM Studio. This will allow for the creation of MCP orchestrations and their execution in parallel.
3. Implement a feedback loop in OpenSpec through the use of AI agents. These can be trained to analyze and provide insights on specific aspects of the project, such as architecture or coding style. AI agents should be able to ask questions and receive answers through MCP.
4. Create a system for document updates in LM Studio using the `DocumentManager` component. This will allow users to update documents in real-time during development. Document updates can include changes to specific sections, as well as overall project status.
5. Integrate the AI agents and feedback loops into MCP orchestration through the use of the `MLSEngine` class provided by LM Studio. This will allow for automated updates to OpenSpec documents based on insights from AI agents.
6. Create a recursive improvement loop within OpenSpec that integrates all components above, as well as other relevant systems. The loop should be designed with an emphasis on self-improvement and continuous improvement of the project.
7. Test the system thoroughly to ensure it is functioning correctly and meets user requirements.
8. Continuously update and improve the system based on feedback received from users.
