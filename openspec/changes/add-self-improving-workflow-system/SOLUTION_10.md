### User Story: Implement a Self-Improving Workflow System Using OpenSpec and MCP Orchestraator

As a Geometry OS expert systems engineer working on Geometry OS, I want to implement a self-improving workflow system that integrates OpenSpec proposal/review cycles with MCP orchestration and LM Studio AI capabilities in a recursive improvement loop. This will enable the development of autonomous software systems that can automatically adapt and learn from insights gained through feedback loops.

Goals:
1. Design and implement a self-improving workflow system that integrates OpenSpec proposal/review cycles with MCP orchestration and LM Studio AI capabilities in a recursive improvement loop.
2. Coordinate specification development with AI assistance.
3. Enable AI agents to ask questions and get answers through MCP.
4. Automatically update documents based on insight gained from feedback loops.
5. Create feedback loops for system improvement.

Design:
1. The Self-Improving Workflow System will integrate OpenSpec proposal/review cycles with MCP orchestration via the OpenSpec API (Open Specification Proposal). The MCP Orchestraator will be responsible for coordinating the proposal/review cycle and providing feedback to developers.
2. A self-improving workflow system will be designed using a recursive improvement loop with a feedback-loop component that executes on each iteration.
3. An internal system, called QR (Question/Response) Routing, will allow developers to create and execute questions, and have the answers provided by MCP orchestration via the LM Studio AI Bridge.
4. The workflow system will be designed to automatically update documents based on feedback gained from the AI agents.
5. Feedback loops for system improvement will be integrated into the workflow system using a feedback-loop component that executes on each iteration.
6. The workflow system will incorporate self-improving features, such as self-updating and adaptive suggestions based on feedback from both human users and AI agents.

Architecture Overview:
The Self-Improving Workflow System is designed using a recursive improvement loop with an internal system called QR (Question/Response) Routing. The workflow system will be implemented using OpenSpec proposal/review cycles with MCP orchestration via the OpenSpec API. Each iteration of the workflow system will include a self-improving component that integrates OpenSpec proposal/review cycles and MCP orchestration, as well as a feedback-loop component that executes on each iteration.

To illustrate how this works in practice, let's consider an example scenario:

Scenario 1: A Geometry OS project requires specification of a new feature for the platform. The team uses OpenSpec proposal/review cycles to solicit input from developers and stakeholders. As feedback is received, MCP orchestration is used to provide insights on how to improve the design based on user feedback.

- OpenSpec proposal/review cycle: Developers submit proposals for the new feature.
- MCP orchestration: MCP orchestrates a dialogue between the team and stakeholders, soliciting input and feedback on the proposed feature. This includes discussions about technical architecture, requirements, usability, and scalability.
- OpenSpec proposal/review cycle: Developers review and revise proposals based on user feedback received from MCP orchestration.
- MCP orchestration: MCP orchestrates a dialogue between the team and stakeholders, soliciting further insights to improve the design. This includes discussions about testing scenarios, performance optimization, and scalability.

In this scenario, MCP orchestration provides insight on how to improve the design based on user feedback, which is then integrated into OpenSpec proposal/review cycles through QR (Question/Response) Routing. As a result, the team is able to quickly incorporate changes based on real-world insights, resulting in an improved feature for the platform.

Conclusion:
The Self-Improving Workflow System is designed using a recursive improvement loop with an internal system called QR (Question/Response) Routing. This architecture allows for self-improving features, such as self-updating and adaptive suggestions based on feedback from both human users and AI agents, ensuring that the development of autonomous software systems is continually improving over time.
