The Self-Improving Workflow System is designed to integrate OpenSpec proposals and review cycles with MCP orchestration, LM Studio AI capabilities, and a recursive improvement loop. The system consists of four main components: OpenSpec, MCP Orchestrator, LM Studio, and Workflow Orchestrator (WO).

1. External Systems: These are OpenSpec specifications that need to be maintained and improved. OpenSpec is the primary component responsible for managing these specifications.

2. Workflow Orchestrator: This component handles workflow orchestration and feedback loops. It includes the Workflow Orchestrator, a system for managing workflows and running tasks. The Workflow Orchestrator receives instructions from OpenSpec, executes them as needed, and updates documents accordingly.

3. QR (Question-Answering): This component enables AI agents to ask questions and get answers through MCP. QR uses the ML Studio AI Bridge to connect with LM Studio for analysis and suggestions.

4. WO (Workflow Orchestrator): This component handles workflow orchestration and feedback loops. It includes the Workflow Manager, a system that manages workflows and runs tasks. The Workflow Manager receives instructions from OpenSpec, executes them as needed, and updates documents accordingly.

5. DM (Document Manager): This component is responsible for managing document versions and version control. It includes the Document Manager, which allows users to create, edit, and manage documents.

6. LMS (LM Studio): This component provides analysis and suggestions via ML Studio. It includes the LM Studio Client, which connects with LM Studio for analysis and suggestions.

7. Recursive Impovement Loop: This is a recursive loop that continuously improves OpenSpec specifications by integrating them with MCP orchestration, LM Studio AI capabilities, and feedback loops. It includes the Workflow Orchestrator, QR, WO, DM, and LMS components.

The Self-Improving Workflow System enables AI agents to ask questions and get answers through MCP, which improves OpenSpec specifications by providing insights, suggestions, and automated updates. The system also integrates with LM Studio for analysis and suggestions, resulting in improved workflows and more effective decision making.

Overall, the Self-Improving Workflow System provides a unified workflow system that integrates OpenSpec proposals, MCP orchestration, AI agents, and recursive improvement loops to improve document specifications.
