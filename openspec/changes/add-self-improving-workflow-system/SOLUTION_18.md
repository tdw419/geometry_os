# Solution for Task: Test recursive improvement loop with sample workflows

In summary, the proposed self-improving workflow system integrates OpenSpec proposals and reviews with MCP orchestration and LM Studio AI capabilities in a recursive improvement loop. The main components are:

1. An external systems architecture consisting of OpenSpec, MCP Orchestrator, and LM Studio.
2. A Workflow Orchestrator that coordinates specification development with AI assistance. This component integrates with MCP orchestration to enable AI agents to ask questions and get answers through MCP. The system also provides automated document updates based on insight gained from the AI agent's suggestions.
3. An external system architecture consisting of OpenSpec, MCP Orchestrator, LM Studio, and Feedback Loop (FL). This component integrates with MCP orchestration to enable AI agents to ask questions and get answers through MCP. It also provides automated feedback loops for system improvement based on the insight gained from the AI agent's suggestions.

The workflow system integrates OpenSpec proposal/review cycles with MCP orchestration and LM Studio AI capabilities in a recursive improvement loop, allowing for true autonomous development and continuous improvement. The system enables AI agents to ask questions and get answers through MCP, automatically update documents based on insight gained from the AI agent's suggestions, and create feedback loops for system improvement.

The architecture of the proposed system ensures that each component functions independently while working together seamlessly. This allows for self-improvement in OpenSpec proposals and reviews, which can lead to better quality work and reduced development time. The recursive nature of the system provides a continuous learning loop, allowing AI agents to gain insights and make recommendations in real-time.

The proposed workflow system is designed to be scalable, adaptive, and flexible. It can accommodate different types of proposals, reviews, and systems, allowing for easy integration with existing OpenSpec workflows. The system can also handle a wide range of AI agents, from simple queries to complex decision-making models.

Overall, the proposed self-improving workflow system offers a robust and efficient solution for managing OpenSpec proposals and reviews in an AI-powered development environment.
