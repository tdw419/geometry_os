# Solution for Task: Add configuration management and environment variable handling

- **Workflow Integration:** The Self-Improving Workflow System integrates OpenSpec proposal/review cycles with MCP orchestration and LM Studio AI capabilities in a recursive improvement loop, which enables self-improvement through continuous feedback.
  - OpenSpec documents are integrated with MCP's specification workflow. This allows for the creation of more detailed specifications that can be used to automate the proposal/review process.
  - MCP orchestrates the AI agent's query and update requests to the OpenSpec document database, allowing for better documentation quality and efficiency.
  - LM Studio is integrated with the OpenSpec workflow system to facilitate AI-assisted suggestions and updates to documents.
  - The Self-Improving Workflow System is designed to be recursive, meaning that it continuously iterates on itself, enabling self-improvement through feedback loops.
- **AI Integration:** OpenSpec's document management system (DM) is integrated with LM Studio AI capabilities, allowing for AI agents to ask questions and get answers through MCP. This enhances the quality of documentation by providing more thorough insights into design decisions.
  - The OpenSpec database also allows for analyzing insights generated by LM Studio's AI agent, which can be used to update OpenSpec documents based on the insight.
- **Question-Answering:** OpenSpec documents are automatically updated through MCP's question-answering feature, allowing for seamless feedback loops between OpenSpec and MCP. The system provides feedback in real-time, enabling developers to address issues proactively.
  - LM Studio AI agents can also provide feedback to OpenSpec document authors using the same system, which helps to improve design quality by ensuring that documents are up-to-date with the latest changes and insights.
- **SeLf-Updating Documents:** The Self-Improving Workflow System automatically updates OpenSpec documents based on feedback from AI agents. This provides users with a seamless feedback loop, helping them to improve their design decisions over time.
  - OpenSpec documents are created and maintained using the same workflow system as OpenSpec itself, making it easier for developers to maintain and update OpenSpec documents.
- **Recursive Improvement Loop:** The Self-Improving Workflow System is designed in a recursive manner that allows for self-improvement through continuous feedback. This means that the system continuously iterates on itself, enabling users to improve their design decisions over time.
