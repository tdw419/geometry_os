# Proposal: fix-memory-leaks-daemon

Area: Missing Core Functionality

Description:
Incomplete implementation of some critical system components that are essential for the functionality of the project.

Previous Problem Statement:
The project involves designing and implementing a new e-commerce platform that will cater to the growing demand for online shopping among our client's target market. However, we have encountered several challenges in the development process due to the absence of essential system components. These components include:

1. Integration with payment gateway providers: The platform must integrate seamlessly with multiple payment gateways to offer a complete range of payment options to our clients' customers. Currently, the project is only compatible with one payment gateway provider.

2. Implementation of a search engine: A robust search engine must be integrated into the platform to enable customers to efficiently and easily find products based on their preferences. The current search system does not meet the client's requirements and needs.

3. Real-time stock tracking: An efficient real-time stock tracking system is crucial for our clients to monitor inventory levels in real-time, especially during peak demand periods. Currently, we have a manual tracking system that causes delays in transactions.

Benefits:
Complete functionality of these critical components will enhance the platform's overall user experience and drive significant revenue growth for our client. For instance, a seamless integration with payment gateways would enable us to offer more payment options to our clients' customers, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. Implementation of a robust search engine would allow our clients to efficiently find products based on their preferences, leading to higher conversion rates and revenue growth. Real-time stock tracking will facilitate accurate inventory management, reducing stockouts and improving operational efficiency.

Risks:
The absence of these essential system components may result in delays or decreased functionality during the development process, resulting in a substandard product or lower user satisfaction levels. The integration with payment gateways may also encounter technical issues that negatively affect the project's overall success. Real-time stock tracking may cause delays in transactions, which could lead to customer complaints and loss of business revenue.

Timeline Estimate:
We propose a timeframe for the implementation of these critical components as follows:

1. Integration with payment gateway providers: 3 months
2. Implementation of real-time stock tracking system: 6 months

In conclusion, we strongly believe that integrating the above-mentioned components will enhance our client's overall product offering and contribute significantly to their success. We hope this proposal meets your needs and is a helpful starting point for the project development.
