# Change: manual-overview

## Problem Statement
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: This roadmap addresses the critical bottleneck in the self-improvement workflow: **LLM JSON Output Reliability**. The current system fails catastrophically when the LLM produces malformed JSON, even when the semantic content is correct. This roadmap introduces a **JSON Repair Sub-Cycle** that treats syntax errors as correctable rather than fatal.

## Proposed Solution
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Overview

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Medium complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (automated implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- **Goal**: Overview
