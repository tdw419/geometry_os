Subject: Geometry OS Implementation Plan for OpenSpec Task

Dear [Name],

I am writing to provide a concise and detailed plan for the implementation of new scripts required for the change ID [Change ID]. The goal of this plan is to ensure that we have a seamless integration between our existing Geometry OS platform and the newly added Compositor integration daemon, which will be used to enable new features such as 3D printing.

Please find below a detailed breakdown of the required files and scripts:

File Paths Required:

1. `geom_os/graphics/index.html`: This file is where the Geometry OS platform will render its geometry rendering. The new scripts require changes to this file, which will include the inclusion of new scripts for 3D printing, such as `print_script.py` and `renderer.py`.

Scripts Required:

2. `geom_os/graphics/print_script.py`: This script will be used to add support for 3D printing to the Geometry OS platform. The script will require changes to the `geom_os/graphics` directory.

3. `geom_os/graphics/renderer.py`: This script will be used to render 3D geometry onto the Geometry OS platform, and will require modifications to the `geom_os/graphics` directory.

Next Steps:

1. Create a new file in the `geom_os/graphics` directory called `print_script.html`. This file will contain the new scripts for 3D printing, as well as any other necessary changes to the existing Geometry OS platform.
2. Run the script `print_script.py` from within a terminal or command prompt. This script will then generate an HTML file containing the new print script code.
3. Modify the `geom_os/graphics/index.html` file by adding the new script to the `<script>` tag.
4. Once the script has been successfully integrated, run the test script and ensure that the 3D printing feature works as expected.
5. Create a new directory called `geom_os/graphics/renderer` within the `geom_os` directory. This directory will contain the new renderer script for 3D geometry rendering.
6. Modify the `geom_os/graphics/index.html` file by adding the new renderer to the `<script>` tag.
7. Run the test script and ensure that the 3D printing feature works as expected.
8. Publish the updated Geometry OS platform with the new 3D printing feature included.

I hope this plan meets your requirements, and please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Best regards,
