Subject: Geometry OS Implementation Plan for Add-on Composition Service

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am pleased to provide you with a concise implementation plan or code solution for the OpenSpec task entitled "Add-on Composition Service" as part of the Geometry OS project.

Task: Test service installation

The Add-on Composition Service is an open source software that allows users to create and deploy customized 3D shapes. It provides a user-friendly interface for composing, manipulating, and publishing 3D models. The current Geometry OS version supports a limited set of add-ons.

To enhance the functionality of the Add-on Composition Service, we propose implementing the following changes:

1. Create a new daemon to manage the composition service installation process. This daemon would be responsible for handling the installation and configuration of the Add-on Composition Service. The daemon should provide a command line interface that enables users to perform tasks such as installing the service, configuring it, and running it.

2. Implement a RESTful API to communicate with the daemon. This API would allow developers to create custom add-ons and publish them to the Add-on Composition Service.

3. Provide a user interface for configuration of the composition service. The UI should allow users to configure various settings such as the maximum number of shapes, the minimum size of shapes, the default shape format, and more.

4. Implement testing procedures for the new daemon and its API. This would include unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests.

5. Document the new daemon and API in a clear and concise manner so that they can be easily understood by developers working on Geometry OS projects.

6. Add additional features to the composition service such as a preview feature for viewing 3D models before publishing them, support for multiple shape formats, and more.

Planning:

1. Identify the necessary file paths that need to be created or modified. This includes creating directories for storing configuration files, log files, and other system-related files.

2. Create a test environment using Docker containers. This will ensure that our proposed changes work correctly in a controlled environment.

3. Prepare a brief code snippet for the new daemon. This should be written in Python or Rust (if required). The code should handle the installation, configuration, and publishing of add-ons. It should also provide a user-friendly interface for developers to create custom add-ons.

4. Create a detailed plan for testing the new daemon and API. This includes testing against different configurations, environments, and OS versions.

5. Prepare a documentation template in Markdown format that outlines the new daemon and its features. This will help developers understand how to use the daemon and its API.

6. Communicate with stakeholders such as Geometry OS engineers, community members, and customers to ensure that the proposed changes are aligned with the project's requirements and goals.

Conclusion:

I hope this implementation plan meets your needs and is well-documented. If there are any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. I look forward to working with you on this project.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
