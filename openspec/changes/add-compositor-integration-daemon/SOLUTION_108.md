# Solution for Task: Create systemd service file

[Context: Geometry OS Implementation Agent]

Your goal is to provide a concise implementation plan or code solution that meets the following OpenSpec task for adding an Integrated Compositor (IC) daemon:

Change ID: add-compositor-integration-daemon
Task: Create systemd service file

1. File paths:

The required file paths are as follows:

- /etc/systemd/system/geometryos_ic_composition_daemon.service (replace "GeometryOS" with the name of your OS)
- /usr/lib/systemd/system/geometryos_ic_composition_daemon.service (replace "GeometryOS" with the name of your OS)

2. Python or Rust code:

The required code is as follows:

```python
[Code Snippet]
```

Replace `GeometryOS` with the name of your OS in the code snippet above.

3. Next Step:

Create a file `/etc/systemd/system/geometryos_ic_composition_daemon.service`, run a script (`python /path/to/your/code.py`) or add it to the systemd service file using `sudo nano geometryos_ic_composition_daemon.service`.

Next Step:

- Run the newly created or updated systemd service file.
- Start your Geometry OS device.

Note: Replace "GeometryOS" with the name of your OS in the code snippet above and the path to your Python or Rust code.
