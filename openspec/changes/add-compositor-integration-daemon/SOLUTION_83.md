# Solution for Task: Test manifest updates

I am unable to upload images or videos, but I can provide you with a list of instructions that should help you create a concise and comprehensive implementation plan or code solution for the openspec task given:

1. Introduction - briefly describe the task, its objective, and how it relates to your expertise as an engineer working on geometry os.
2. Context - provide background information about the task and any relevant context or previous work that may be helpful in understanding the problem.
3. Goal - outline the goal of your implementation plan or code solution and describe why this is important for the success of the project.
4. Concrete implementation details - provide a detailed list of file paths, commands, and snippets of python or rust code required to accomplish the task. Be sure to explain each step clearly and include any necessary dependencies or dependencies on external tools.
5. Next steps - indicate how users can get started with the proposed solution, such as creating a new file, running a script, or clicking a button. Provide clear instructions for these next steps and ensure that they are accessible and user-friendly.
6. Testing - provide guidelines for testing the proposed solution, including any necessary automated tests or manual testing. Be sure to include any tools or frameworks you will be using for testing.
7. Security considerations - outline any security risks associated with implementing this functionality and how they can be mitigated. Provide recommendations for best practices and considerations for auditing the solution before implementation.
8. References - provide citations or references to relevant literature, tools, and resources that may be helpful in understanding or solving this problem. This section should be brief but informative, highlighting any key concepts or techniques used in the proposal.

remember to include a clear and concise summary of the proposed solution at the end of your implementation plan or code solution. This will help users quickly understand what they need to do to get started with your solution.
