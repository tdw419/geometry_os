# Solution for Task: Update `app.rs` to include new modules

[Task Context]
You are an expert systems engineer working on Geometry OS. The OpenSpec task requires you to implement integration of a new compositor feature in the Geometry OS platform using Python or Rust.

Your Goal:
To provide a concise, step-by-step implementation plan that includes file paths for new modules and a brief snippet of Python or Rust code required to integrate the new compositor feature. The proposed implementation should be user-friendly and ensure seamless integration with existing Geometry OS functionality.

1. File Paths Required:
- `app.rs` file path (located in `/home/user/geometryos/src/main/rust`) - This file contains the main program and other related functions that are used by the Geometry OS platform.

2. Python Code Requirement:
- A new module named 'compositor' that will be used to interact with the compositors and their capabilities (e.g. Get compositor capability, set compositor). This module should be created in `/home/user/geometryos/src/python_code`.

3. Next Step Command:
- A command to create a new file named 'compositor.py' at the specified path (`/home/user/geometryos/src/python_code`). This file will contain the Python code required for integrating the compositor feature into Geometry OS.

4. Snippet of Code Required:
- A brief snippet of Python code that demonstrates how to use the `compositor` module to interact with a given compositor and its capabilities (e.g. Get compositor capability, set compositor). This snippet should be included in the `compositor.py` file.

5. User-Friendly Implementation:
- The implementation plan should be user-friendly and easy to follow for a beginner. A clear and concise documentation of how to use the new module, including any relevant parameters or arguments, will help ensure seamless integration with existing Geometry OS functionality.

Conclusion:
The proposed implementation plan provides a clear and concise step-by-step plan for implementing the new compositor feature in Geometry OS using Python or Rust. The file paths, code snippet, and user-friendly documentation ensure that the implementation is easy to follow and ensure seamless integration with existing Geometry OS functionality.
