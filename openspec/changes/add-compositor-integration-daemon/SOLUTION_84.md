# Solution for Task: Test reconnection logic

Write a Python function that takes in two lists of integers representing a binary tree and returns the depth of each node in the binary tree. The function should calculate the length of the longest path from any root node to any leaf node (the only nodes with no children). Your function should handle both circular and non-circular trees, as well as trees with different levels of depth. Use clear variable names, comments, and indentation to make your code easy to understand and maintain.
