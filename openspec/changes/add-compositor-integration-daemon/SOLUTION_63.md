# Solution for Task: Initialize compositor client on page load

[Header]
You are an expert systems engineer working on Geometry OS.

Your goal is to provide a concreted implementation plan or code solution for the following OpenSpec task:
Change ID: add-compositor-integration-daemon

Context:
The task involves implementing a compositor client in Geometry OS that will allow users to interact with external compositors like Wayland, X11, and Wayland-EGL on desktop Linux systems. The implementation plan includes the following steps:

1. File Paths:
   A brief snippet of Python or Rust code is required that creates a file path for the GeometryOS compositor client, such as '/usr/bin/geometryos_compositor_client'. This command should be added to the appropriate section in the system configuration.

2. Compositor Integration:
   A more detailed implementation plan with instructions on how to create and run a script that interacts with Wayland or X11 compositors is required. The script should allow users to select which external compositor they want to use, connect to it, and control its behavior.

3. Next Steps:
   A clear Markdown format is preferred for this task. Users will be prompted to create a file, run a script, or perform some other action based on the implementation plan. The next step should be clearly labeled with an 'Next Step' command that directs users to follow the required steps.

4. Documentation:
   A comprehensive and detailed implementation plan and documentation will be required for all steps of this task. This documentation should include instructions on how to run the script, troubleshoot issues, and ensure compatibility with various compositor clients.

5. Testing:
   Prior to submitting the implementation plan and documentation, a comprehensive set of tests should be conducted to ensure that the implementation is working as intended. These tests should cover all aspects of the code and functionality required for the task.

6. Deployment:
   Once the implementation plan and documentation are complete, they should be reviewed and approved by the assigned reviewers before being deployed to production environments.

7. Maintenance:
   The implementation plan and documentation will continue to be maintained and updated as needed based on feedback from users and changes in the compositor client or Wayland/X11 ecosystem.
