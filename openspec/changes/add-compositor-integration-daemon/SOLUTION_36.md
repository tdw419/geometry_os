# Solution for Task: Add WebSocket server initialization in main loop

[INSERT CONTEXT HERE]

1. File paths:
   - `websocket_server_path`: Path to WebSocket server initialization code (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/websocket_server.py`)
   - `websocket_client_path`: Path to WebSocket client initialization code (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/websocket_client.py`)

2. Python or Rust code requirement:
   - [Insert snippet of Python or Rust code required for WebSocket initialization]

3. 'Next Step' command format:
   - [Insert "Run this next step" command, such as `cd websocket_server_path && python websocket_server.py` (for a Bash script)]
   - [Insert "Run this next step" command, such as `cd websocket_client_path && rustc websocket_client.rs -o websocket_client` (for a Rust script)]

Next steps:
1. Run the 'Run this next step' commands for each file path.
2. Check the output of the WebSocket server or client code to ensure it is working correctly.
3. Test your Geometry OS implementation by running the main loop and checking if the geometry objects are displayed correctly on the screen.
