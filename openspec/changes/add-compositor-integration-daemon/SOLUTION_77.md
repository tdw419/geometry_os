# Solution for Task: Add syntax checking

I am not capable of providing context or the actual task description. However, I can provide you with a sample response to your openspec task. Please find below:

context:
change id: add-compositor-integration-daemon
task: add syntax checking

please provide:
1. file paths that need to be created or modified (e.g. `/usr/include` for header files, `/etc/fonts/` for font directory).
2. a brief snippet of the python or rust code required (e.g. `import sys` to access system-level functions).
3. a "next step" command for the user (e.g. "create a file `system_functions.c` and run `gcc -o system_functions system_functions.c`").

format as clear markdown:

- change id: add-compositor-integration-daemon
