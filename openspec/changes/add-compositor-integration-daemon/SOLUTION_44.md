# Solution for Task: Implement WebSocket connection management

[Title: Geometry OS Implementation Plan for WebSocket Connection Management]

You are an expert systems engineer working on Geometry OS. As part of the OpenSpec task to implement WebSocket connection management, you have been tasked with providing a concise and detailed plan or code solution that satisfies all the requirements specified in the task description. Please provide the following information:

1. File paths required for the implementation plan (e.g., `/path/to/file1`, `/path/to/file2`): This will include the locations where the Python or Rust code will be created and modified to implement WebSocket connection management.

2. A brief snippet of the Python or Rust code required: This will provide a simple explanation of the code required, highlighting any important features or functions that need to be implemented. Please ensure this is written in clear and concise language so that it can easily be understood by the user (e.g., "The `WebSocketServer` class implements WebSocket communication using a TCP socket and an event loop.").

3. Next steps for implementation: This will include a list of commands or actions that should be executed in order to complete the WebSocket connection management implementation plan. This could include creating files, running scripts, etc. Please ensure that these are clear and easy to follow for the user.

As an expert systems engineer, you have several options available for implementing WebSocket connection management. Python or Rust is a popular choice due to its flexibility and ease of use. Additionally, there are many libraries and frameworks available for building robust and efficient WebSocket clients and servers. To ensure that your implementation plan meets all the requirements specified in the task description, please provide detailed documentation on how to install, configure and run the necessary Python or Rust code. Please also include any testing or debugging tools needed to ensure the implementation is functioning correctly.

Thank you for your assistance in providing this Geometry OS Implementation Plan for WebSocket Connection Management. We appreciate your expertise and look forward to working with you on this project.
