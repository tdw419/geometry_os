# Proposal: add-neural-perception-kernel-for-holodeck

Area: Performance
Description: Missing core functionality: The system lacks the necessary components to fully support the visual and haptic feedback for navigation tasks, leading to performance bottlenecks and slow processing times.
Priority: High
Affected Components: Daemon

Problem Statement:
The current Geometry OS application lacks the necessary components to provide a seamless user experience for navigating through complex environments or performing visual and haptic feedback tasks. This lack of functionality hinders the overall performance of the system, leading to slow processing times, excessive resource usage, and ultimately frustrated users.

Proposed Solution:
To address this issue, we propose implementing a new daemon that will provide essential functionality for visual and haptic feedback. The daemon will consist of two components - one for rendering visual feedback (such as images or animations) and another for providing haptic feedback (such as vibration or sound). This solution will not only improve the overall performance but also ensure a seamless user experience, leading to reduced frustration and increased satisfaction with the application.

Benefits:
- Improved Performance: The new daemon will provide faster processing times and better visual and haptic feedback, reducing the need for frequent system restarts that can cause issues or slow performance.
- Better User Experience: The new daemon will provide a smoother and more intuitive interface that seamlessly integrates with visual and haptic feedback features, providing an overall more enjoyable and satisfying experience.
- Cost-Effective: The implementation of the new daemon will be cost-effective as it will reduce the need for frequent system restarts, saving on hardware maintenance costs and reducing downtime associated with system crashes or other issues.

Risks:
- Implementation Complexity: Implementing a new daemon may present some technical challenges such as integrating different components or configuring systems to support visual and haptic feedback functionality. This could result in a higher implementation cost.
- Resource Consumption: The new daemon will require more resources than the current system, leading to potential overload on hardware or software resources. This risk can be mitigated through careful planning and resource allocation.

Timeframe:
The implementation of the new daemon is expected to take approximately 2-3 months. This timeframe allows for adequate testing and optimization of the components before integration into the system.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, we believe that implementing a new daemon as a solution to the performance bottlenecks present in our current Geometry OS system is an essential step towards improving user experience while reducing resource consumption and overall system costs. This proposal highlights the benefits of the proposed solution, including increased performance and improved user experience while also being cost-effective. We anticipate this proposal to receive positive feedback and recommend it for implementation.
