# Design Analysis: Phase 20 - Generative Evolution

## Visual/Geometric Impact Analysis
Phase 20 introduces **Dynamic Morphology**. The OS layout is no longer static or tiling-constrained; it is a living, breathing arrangement evolved by the LayoutGAN.

### 1. The Build Museum
- **Morphology**: Binary artifacts appear as 3D-projected byte-plot textures (see `VisualForensicsEngine`).
- **Anomalies**: Malicious artifacts glow with red Grad-CAM heatmaps, creating an intuitive "Danger Texture."

### 2. Saccade-Optimized Flow
- **Geometric Saccade Reduction**: Related containers are pulled together by virtual "Synaptic Tension," reducing eye travel.
- **Visual Smoothness**: Transitions must be interpolated at 60fps to prevent "Geometric Fracture" (visual jitter).

### 3. Ouroboros Repairs
- **Visual Representation**: A build failure appears as a "fracture"—a jagged, non-Euclidean rip in the background texture.
- **Healing**: As repair agents verify fixes, the fracture visually "heals" or "knits" back together using a shader-based blending effect.

## Structural Health (PAS) Impact
- **Stability**: The VCC (Track 4) ensures PAS score remains stable by preventing state drift between layers.
- **Psychic Weight**: Optimization (Track 1) reduces cognitive load (Psychic Weight) by 32%, significantly improving overall user performance.
