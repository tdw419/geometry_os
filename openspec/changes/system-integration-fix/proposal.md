# Proposal: system-integration-fix

Area: System Integration

Description: The visual shell core integration with the hardware feederaction is incomplete. This should be completed in a future phase.

Priority: High
Affected Components: Phase 34 Completion Report

Proposed Solution:

The proposed solution for the gap area of system integration involves integrating the visual shell core with the hardware feeders. This will allow the visual shell to communicate directly with the hardware, enabling a more seamless and efficient workflow.

Benefits:
- Enhanced efficiency: The integrated system will allow for faster and more accurate communication between the visual shell and the hardware, leading to reduced downtime and improved productivity.
- Improved safety: With the integration of the visual shell core, the hardware feeders can be monitored more closely, ensuring that the equipment is functioning correctly and preventing accidents.
- Increased reliability: The integrated system will provide a more robust and reliable system, reducing the likelihood of failures or malfunctions.

Risks:
- Costly implementation: Integrating the visual shell core with the hardware feeders will require significant investment in technology and personnel. This could be a barrier to implementation if funding is not available.
- Technical difficulties: The integration may require specialized knowledge and expertise, which may be difficult to find or obtain.

Timeframe:
The proposed solution will be implemented over the next phase, Phase 34 of the project. This will ensure that the system integration is completed in a timely and efficient manner.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, integrating the visual shell core with the hardware feeders is an essential step towards improving system efficiency and safety. The proposed solution will provide a more seamless and reliable workflow, enhancing productivity and safety for all stakeholders in the project.
