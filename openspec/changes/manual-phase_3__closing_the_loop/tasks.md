# Tasks: manual-phase_3__closing_the_loop

- [x] **Task 1**: **Goal**: Phase 3: Closing the Loop

**Description**: Modify the `Evolution Daemon` from Phase 1. The daemon will wait for the agent to complete. Upon successful completion (all tests passing), it will commit the changes to version control with a message describing the automated fix. The daemon will then return to its monitoring state, waiting for the next problem.

**Key Deliverables**:
- **Objective 3: Orchestrate the Full Cycle**
- **Goal:** Connect the Daemon to the Agent to create a seamless, end-to-end recursive loop.
- **Tasks:**
- After it successfully generates a `tasks.md` file, it will invoke the `Implementation Agent`, passing it the file path.
  - **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - All requirements for 'Phase 3: Closing the Loop' are implemented and functional.
  - **Estimated Effort**: Medium


## Summary
- **Total Tasks**: 1
- **Estimated Complexity**: Medium
- **Dependencies**: None
