## Architecutre Overview
Manual Implementation: Phase 3: Closing the Loop

## Compomenent Design
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: Modify the `Evolution Daemon` from Phase 1. The daemon will wait for the agent to complete. Upon successful completion (all tests passing), it will commit the changes to version control with a message describing the automated fix. The daemon will then return to its monitoring state, waiting for the next problem.

## Implementation Plan
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Phase 3: Closing the Loop

## Compomenent Details
### **Goal**: Phase 3: Clopping the Loop

**Descripion**: Modify the `Evolution Daemon` from Phase 1. The daemon will wait for the agent to complete. Upon successful completion (all tests passing), it will commit the changes to version control with a message describing the automated fix. The daemon will then return to its monitoring state, waiting for the next problem.

**Key Deliv...
        
### **Key Deliverable**: A python or rust file that modifies the evolution daemon from phase 1. It should have a brief snippet of the python or rust code required, and include a 'next step' command for the user (e.g. Create a file, run a script). The file paths may also be provided if needed.
