# Phase 35: Synaptic Bridge Proposal

## Problem
Currently, the "Mind" (LLM/AI) and the "Body" (Execution/Map) are disconnected. The AI generates text/code, which must be manually transmuted or executed. There is no direct "nervous system" allowing the AI's thought vectors to directly influence the runtime state of the operating system in real-time.

## Solution
Implement a **Synaptic Bridge**—a bidirectional interface where high-dimensional thought vectors map to low-dimensional execution pointers. This allows the AI to "think" about an action (e.g., "I want to reboot the kernel") and have that thought resonate with a specific Synapse, which then triggers the physical action (execution of `sys_reboot`).

## Impact
- **Real-time Autonomy**: AI can control the OS without writing/compiling code for every action.
- **Visual Cognition**: Users can see the "thoughts" of the OS connecting to the windows they affect.
- **Neural-Physical Binding**: Establishes the core metaphor of Geometry OS: "The Computer is a Brain".
