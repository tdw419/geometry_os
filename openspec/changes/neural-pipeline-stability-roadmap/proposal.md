# Neural Pipeline Stability Roadmap

## Summary

Systematically improve the Geometry OS neural/LLM bridge system through immediate fixes, stability enhancements, scalability improvements, and long-term GPU acceleration.

## Motivation

This change implements the architecture described below, enabling spec-driven development
and verification of the implementation.

## Architecture

The neural pipeline consists of:

## Tech Stack

Python (asyncio, aiohttp), Rust (wgpu, WebSocket), Unix sockets, SSE (Server-Sent Events), LM Studio API

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| (See tasks.md for detailed file list) | |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tasks in tasks.md are completed
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
