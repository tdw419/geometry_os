# Solution for Task: **Task 2**: Implement Z-Indexing and Focus Management: Add click event listeners to all active windows. When a user clicks or interacts with any window, it must be moved above other non-active windows in the render order (e.g., re-inserted into parent container at index 0).

# Change: Phase 2 Desktop Interactions

## Problem Statement
Enhance Phase 1's static desktop shell with interactive window management capabilities. This includes implementing drag-to-resize logic for windows, a scrollable content container (ScrollBox) to handle overflow scenarios in complex apps or settings panel, and an accessible 'Start' menu launcher system that spawns demo applications programmatically.

## Proposed Solution
To transform PixiJS Desktop Environment from a visual prototype into a functional desktop simulation. Window resizing provides necessary screen real estate management for complex apps; scrolling is essential to support content-heavy interfaces without breaking immersion or canvas scaling limits (if applicable); and Z-indexing ensure that the user can multi-task effectively by focusing on specific applications.

## Impact Assessment
- Scope: Large complexity
- Risk: Medium risk (breaks immersion, canvas scaling limits)

--- Design

- Architecture Overview
  - Implement core desktop interactivity and UI components such as drag-to-resize logic for windows, a scrollable content container (ScrollBox), and an accessible 'Start' menu launcher system.
- Component Design: Enhance Phase 1's static desktop shell with interactive window management capabilities by adding the following features:
  - Implement drag-to-resize logic for windows: Users can resize windows on the fly using a mouse or touchpad, making it easier to manage large, complex interfaces.
  - A scrollable content container (ScrollBox): This component allows users to scroll through multiple windows at once without losing focus. It's especially useful for applications that have complex menus or other UI elements that need to be viewed in full-screen mode.
  - An accessible 'Start' menu launcher system: Users can quickly and easily access specific applications by using an accessible menu located on the desktop, making it easy to switch between apps without having to leave the main window.

--- Implementation Plan
To transform Phase 1's static desktop shell into a functional desktop simulation, we propose the following steps:

1. Create or modify file paths for the required components (e.g. Python or Rust code).
2. Write clear Markdown snippets that explain how to use each component in more detail.
3. Provide Next Steps commands for users to follow, such as creating a new file or running a script.
4. Test and iterate on the implementation until it is fully functional and meets user requirements.

Format as clear Markdown:

1. Create or modify file paths for Python or Rust code required to implement drag-to-resize logic for windows, a scrollable content container (ScrollBox), and an accessible 'Start' menu launcher system.
2. Write clear Markdown snippets that explain how to use each component in more detail.
3. Provide Next Steps commands for users to follow, such as creating a new file or running a script.
