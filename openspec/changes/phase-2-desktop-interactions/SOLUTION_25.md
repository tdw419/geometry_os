# Solution for Task: **Task 4**: Implement Start Menu / App Launcher: Create a UI element (e.g., button or keybind) that toggles visibility of the launcher menu. The launchers must be clickable buttons which, when clicked, instantiate and open specific demo windows defined in Phase 1.

Title: Change Implementation Plan for Geometry OS

Introduction
The goal of this change is to provide a concise and functional implementation plan for the phase two tasks related to desktop interactivity (change ID: phase-2-desktop-interactions). The focus of this plan will be on creating an interactive window management system, a scrollable content container (ScrollBox) that can handle overflow scenarios in complex apps or settings panels, and an accessible 'Start' menu launcher system that spawns demo applications programmatically.

Problem Statement
The current static desktop shell for Geometry OS lacks the necessary interactivity and window management capabilities. This issue is due to the lack of a drag-to-resize functionality for windows, which can be added through a UI element (e.g., button or keybind). The launchers must also have clickable buttons that open specific demo applications with proper scaling, zooming, and transparency settings. Additionally, the content container should allow for scrolling to handle overflow scenarios in complex apps or settings panels, which will help users focus on specific applications while avoiding screen clutter.

Solution Proposal
To address this issue, a UI element (e.g., button or keybind) will be added to toggle the visibility of the launcher menu. The launchers will also be clickable buttons that, when clicked, will instantiate and open specific demo applications with proper scaling, zooming, and transparency settings. To handle overflow scenarios in complex apps or settings panels, a ScrollBox will be created to provide a scrollable content container (SCX) that can handle the overflow. The SCX will have an accessible 'Start' menu launcher system that spawns demo applications programmatically.

Impact Assessment
The following impact assessment will be conducted to determine if the proposed solution has any adverse effects on users:

- Scope: Large complexity
- Risk: Medium to high

Design
- The proposed change involves a UI element (button or keybind) that toggles the launcher menu visibility. This will allow users to switch between different window layouts easily without having to click multiple buttons.
- The launchers will also be clickable buttons that, when clicked, will instantiate and open specific demo applications. These demo applications can include popular web browsers, productivity software like Microsoft Office and Google Suite, or entertainment apps like Netflix and YouTube.
- To handle overflow scenarios in complex apps or settings panels, a ScrollBox will be created to provide a scrollable content container (SCX). This SCX will have an accessible 'Start' menu launcher system that spawns demo applications programmatically. The Start menu launcher will allow users to easily access various demos without having to navigate through multiple tabs or windows.

Implementation Plan
To transform PixiJS Desktop Environment from a visual prototype into a functional desktop simulation, the following steps will be taken:

- Implement drag-to-resize functionality for windows using an UI element (e.g., button or keybind).
- Add clickable buttons that open specific demo applications with proper scaling, zooming, and transparency settings.
- Create a ScrollBox to provide a scrollable content container (SCX) that can handle the overflow scenarios in complex apps or settings panels.
- Implement an accessible 'Start' menu launcher system that spawns demo applications programmatically.
