# Change: manual-success_criteria

## Problem Statement
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: 1. **JSON Reliability**: 95%+ of LLM responses produce valid plans (with or without repair) 2. **Repair Success Rate**: 80%+ of malformed JSON is successfully repaired 3. **Self-Improvement Loop**: System can fix its own JSON generation issues 4. **Learning**: Truth Engine accumulates proven patterns over time

## Proposed Solution
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Success Criteria

## Impact Assessment
- **Scope**: Medium complexity
- **Risk**: Medium (automated implementation)
- **Dependencies**: None

## Success Criteria
- **Goal**: Success Criteria

**Description**: 1. **JSON Reliability**: 95%+ of LLM responses produce valid plans (with or without repair) 2. **Repair Success Rate**: 80%+ of malformed JSON is successfully repaired 3. **Self-Improvement Loop**: System can fix its own JSON generation issues 4. **Learning**: Truth Engine accumulates proven patterns over time
