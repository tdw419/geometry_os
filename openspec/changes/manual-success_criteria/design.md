# Design: manual-success_criteria

## Architecture Overview
Manual Implementation: Success Criteria

## Component Design
Manual implementation of roadmap phase: 1. **JSON Reliability**: 95%+ of LLM responses produce valid plans (with or without repair) 2. **Repair Success Rate**: 80%+ of malformed JSON is successfully repaired 3. **Self-Improvement Loop**: System can fix its own JSON generation issues 4. **Learning**: Truth Engine accumulates proven patterns over time

## Implementation Plan
Direct implementation of roadmap requirements for Success Criteria

## Component Details
### **Goal**: Success Criteria

**Description**: 1. **JSON Reliability**: 95%+ of LLM responses produce valid plans (with or without repair) 2. **Repair Success Rate**: 80%+ of malformed JSON is successfully repaired 3. **Self-Improvement Loop**: System can fix its own JSON generation issues 4. **Learning**: Truth Engine accumulates proven patterns over time

- All requirements for 'Success Criteria' are implemented and functional.

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Acceptance tests based on success criteria

## Performance Considerations
- Estimated complexity: Medium
- Parallel execution where possible
- Resource optimization for autonomous execution
