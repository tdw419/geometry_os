# Solution for Task: **Task 1**: **Goal**: Success Criteria

To address the OpenSpec task "Goal" of "Success Criteria", the following is proposed as a manual implementation plan:

1. JSON Reliabilty: The system should ensure that all LLM responses produced by the Truth Engine are valid JSON. This will be achieved by ensuring that the generated plans are structured correctly and have all necessary data structures included in them.
2. Repair Success Rate: The system should fix its own JSON generation issues, which could arise from errors or inconsistencies in the data structure of the LLM responses. The repair process will be automated to ensure consistency and reduce the risk of human error.
3. Self-Improvement Loop: Truth Engine can improve its JSON generation process by accumulating patterns over time. This would allow it to identify common issues and improve the quality of the generated plans.
4. Learning: The system should accumulate proven patterns from past LLM responses to improve future JSON generation. This would help reduce the need for human intervention in the future, allowing Truth Engine to focus on improving its own processes.

The proposed implementation plan includes the following components:

1. Goal: "Success Criteria" (JSON Reliabilty, Repair Success Rate, Self-Improvement Loop, and Learning)

2. Architecture Overview: A manual implementation of roadmap phase: 1. JSON Reliability: 95%+ of LLM responses produce valid plans (with or without repair), 2. Repair Success Ratio: 80%+ of malformed JSON is successfully repaired, 3. Self-Improvement Loop: System can fix its own JSON generation issues, 4. Learning: Truth Engine accumulates proven patterns over time

3. Compoment Design: Manual implementation of roadmap phase:
    a) Goal: Success Criteria (JSON Reliabilty, Repair Success Rate, Self-Improvement Loop, and Learning)

    b) Architecture Overview: A manual implementation of roadmap phase: 1. JSON Reliability: 95%+ of LLM responses produce valid plans (with or without repair), 2.
