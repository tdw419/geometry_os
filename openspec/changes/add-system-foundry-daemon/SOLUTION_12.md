# Problem: Change ID: add-system-foundry-daemon

## Background
While we have the `Foundry Daemon` for converting NL intentions into code brick, we lack an automated task-drive pipeline to convert live Linux system artifacts (binaries, file systems, memory maps) into `.brick` files for spatial visualization on the PixiJS Infinite Map.

## Solution: System Foundry Daemon
Implement a persistent process that monitors OpenSpec tasks, analyzes artifacts via LM Studio, folds via Hilbert Curves, and continuously syncs as system state changes in real-time. This daemon can be implemented using existing tools like `qwen2.5-coder`, `tensor_fold.py`, and Rust.

## Architectural overview:
1. Monitor OpenSpec tasks via local LM Studio for `FoundryTask` definitions, which will trigger the daemon to start analyzing artifacts and folding `.brick` files.
2. Analyze binaries, headers, or logs using local LLMs like `qwen2.5-coder`, which will generate "Semantic Meta Data" for preserved data locality.
3. Fold the `.brick` file generated by the analysis into V2 Spatial Bricks with preserving data locality.
4. Continuously update the `.brick` files in real-time as system state changes, using the "Watch Mode" setting of the daemon.

## Next steps:
1. Provide a brief snippet of the Python or Rust code required for creating or modifying file paths to be analyzed by LM Studio.
2. Provide a brief explanation of the `qwen2.5-coder` LLM and its capabilities, such as generating semantic metadata.
3. Provide a sample script to create a `.brick` file using the `tensor_fold.py` tool.
4. Explain how to set up the daemon in Watch Mode for real-time updating of V2 Spatial Bricks.
5. Provide any other relevant information or resources that may be helpful to the community.
