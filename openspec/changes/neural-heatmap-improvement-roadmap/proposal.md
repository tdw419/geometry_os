# Neural Heatmap Improvement Roadmap

## Summary

Enhance the Neural Heatmap Overlay with real data integration, interactive features, performance optimizations, and data analytics capabilities.

## Motivation

This change implements the architecture described below, enabling spec-driven development
and verification of the implementation.

## Architecture

Multi-phase improvement roadmap building on the existing WebGL-based visualization system. Each phase is independently valuable and can be deployed incrementally.

## Tech Stack

PIXI.js v8, WebGPU/WGSL shaders, WebSocket for real-time data, JavaScript ES6+
