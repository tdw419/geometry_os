# Progress: WordPress Truth Daemon

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Create WordPressClient - feat(wordpress): add WordPressClient for content discovery
- [x] 1.2 Create TruthExtractor - feat(wordpress): add TruthExtractor for LM Studio claim extraction

## Current Task
Awaiting next task (1.3: Create TriadScorer)

## Learnings
- CTRMDatabase uses SQLite with WAL mode for concurrency safety
- CTRMTruthManager.create_truth() accepts externally-computed confidence to skip re-analysis
- LMStudioIntegration has built-in fallback when LM Studio unreachable
- Triad scoring formula: (llm*0.4) + (author*0.3) + (source*0.2) + (corroboration*0.1)
- Category "wordpress_extracted" for filtering WordPress-sourced truths
- Verification uses verify_foundational_truths() with progressive throttling
- ai-publisher.php already has list_posts endpoint; WordPressClient uses new actions: getModifiedContent, updatePostMeta, getPostAuthorInfo (to be added to PHP in Task 2.1)
- TruthExtractor uses EXTRACTION_PROMPT template for structured JSON claim extraction
- ExtractedClaim dataclass includes: statement, confidence, evidence_type (E1/E2/E3), source_context
- Path resolution uses sys.path.insert to import LMStudioIntegration from src/lm_studio/integration.py
- Temperature=0.3 used for consistent extraction results
- Evidence types: E1 (Physical), E2 (Textual), E3 (Logical)
