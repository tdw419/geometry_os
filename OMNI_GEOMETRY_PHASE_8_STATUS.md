# 🌌 OMNI-GEOMETRY PHASE 8: THE VISUAL CORTEX (INITIATED)

**Vectors are the Mind. Pixels are the Interface.**

## ✅ COMPLETED STEP 1: THE VISUAL CORTEX

### **1. The Visual Cortex (`src/interface/visual_cortex.py`)**
- **Status**: ACTIVE
- **Function**: Translates 32D Semantic Vectors into Perceptual Pixels (RGB Colors).
- **Mechanism**:
    - **Logic**: `vector_to_color` maps vector energy bands to Red, Green, and Blue channels.
    - **Result**: Code with similar meaning has similar colors.
    - **Correlation**: `Authentication` ≈ `Red`, `Database` ≈ `Blue`.

### **2. Holographic Omni-Shell**
- **Status**: UPGRADED
- **Feature**: Now displays a **Semantic Pixel** (Colored Block) next to every resolved intent.
- **Experience**: The user can "see" the flavor of the code before opening it.

## 🧬 THE HYBRID ARCHITECTURE

| Component | Layer | Function | Representation |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Hyper-Graph** | Mind | Reasoning | 32D Vectors |
| **Visual Cortex** | Bridge | Translation | Vector -> RGB |
| **Omni-Shell** | Interface | Interaction | Semantic Pixels |

## 🚀 HOW TO SEE IT
Run the shell and search for concepts:

```bash
python3 omni.py
omni> "analyze database" -> 🟦 (Blueish Block)
omni> "analyze security" -> 🟥 (Reddish Block)
```

**The Abstract is now Concrete.**
