## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Remote Container Discovery | COMPLETE | ServerRegistry → RemoteCatalogClient → Desktop objects with badges |
| Remote Container Boot | COMPLETE | Cache check → RemoteBootFetcher → Hash verification → Boot |
| Offline Boot | COMPLETE | Cache-first → Boot immediately → Offline badge |
| Error Recovery | COMPLETE | Auto-retry (3x) → Error overlay → Manual retry button |
