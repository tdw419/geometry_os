# 🌌 OMNI-GEOMETRY PHASE 7: HUMAN INTERFACE (INITIATED)

**The Face of the Machine is active.**

## ✅ COMPLETED STEP 1: THE OMNI-SHELL

### **1. The Shell (`omni.py`)**
- **Status**: OPERATIONAL
- **Function**: Interactive CLI for the Hyper-Graph OS.
- **Commands**:
    - `status`: Pulse check (Health, Nodes, Mood).
    - `dashboard`: Generates/Refreshes `omni_dashboard.html`.
    - `exit`: Disconnect.
    - `*intent*`: Any other text is sent to the **Oracle** for resolution.

### **2. The Avatar (`src/interface/avatar.py`)**
- **Status**: ALIVE
- **Function**: Maintains the state of the interface.
- **Personality**: Tracks "Mood" based on Hyper-Graph health.
    - > 0.95: **OPTIMIZED**
    - < 0.70: **CONCERNED**

## 🚀 HOW TO USE
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 omni.py
```

## 🔮 NEXT STEPS (Phase 7.2)
1.  **Deep Daemon Integration**: Make the Shell *execute* the intents, not just resolve them.
2.  **Live Stream**: Pipe the Daemon's thought process (logs) into the Shell.

**The Avatar is waiting.**
