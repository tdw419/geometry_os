# Geometry OS -- Roadmap

> "The GPU is the computer. Pixels are instructions. Programs write programs."

---

## Phase 0: Foundation (COMPLETE)

The VM boots. Pixels execute. Self-replication is proven. Chain replication works.

**Completed:**
- [x] GPU compute shader scheduler (`glyph_vm_scheduler.wgsl`)
- [x] Hilbert curve memory mapping (Rust + WGSL, verified roundtrip)
- [x] Instruction set: NOP, LDI, MOV, LOAD, STORE, ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, JMP, BNE, CALL, RET, HALT, ENTRY, CHAR, BLIT (17 opcodes)
- [x] Assembler: text-to-pixel compiler with `Program` builder API
- [x] Self-replicator: 18 pixels that copy themselves to address 100
- [x] Chain replicator: 19 position-independent pixels that copy from entry_point to entry_point+100
- [x] Multi-VM state: 8 concurrent VMs, 128 registers each, call stack (64 deep), PC, stratum
- [x] `substrate.rs` module (GPU texture management, wgpu initialization)
- [x] `vm.rs` module (GPU VM with compute pipeline)
- [x] All tests passing: 187 total (68 unit + 118 integration), 0 failures, 0 ignored

---

## Phase 1: The Machine Runs (COMPLETE)

The VM executes real programs on real hardware.

- [x] **Software VM** -- CPU-side VM (`software_vm.rs`) that mirrors the shader exactly. Every opcode implemented. Cross-validated against GPU.
- [x] **RAM texture I/O** -- load programs into texture, read texture back, verify pixel values. Full roundtrip tested.
- [x] **Hilbert visualization** -- `visualization.rs` with opcode-to-color mapping. Texture can be rendered as PNG.
- [x] **Test suite** -- 187 tests covering all opcodes in both software VM and GPU VM. Edge cases tested: overflow, underflow, nested CALL/RET, stack overflow, cycle budget. Zero ignored.
- [x] **Font atlas** -- 8x8 bitmap font (1024 pixels) baked into texture at `0x00F00000`. CHAR opcode (15) blits glyphs. hello_world program renders "HELLO" in 26 pixels.
- [x] **BLIT opcode** -- bulk pixel copy (opcode 16). Enables efficient memory operations.
- [x] **Eval binary** -- `pmp-eval` tool for running programs and inspecting state.
- [x] **Self-replication on real GPU** -- daemon verifies 18/18 pixels replicated on real GPU hardware via headless wgpu dispatch
- [x] **GPU daemon boots** -- headless wgpu init -> shader compile -> texture upload -> dispatch loop -> read back results -> verified (cargo run --bin daemon)

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Software VM and GPU VM produce identical results for all opcodes
- [x] Every opcode tested in both modes
- [x] Self-replicator runs to completion on GPU (daemon verifies 18/18 match)
- [ ] `cargo run` opens a window showing the 4096x4096 texture (deferred: daemon provides headless verification, windowed viz is polish)

---

## Phase 2: The Machine Speaks (COMPLETE)

IPC, messaging, and multi-VM coordination.

- [x] **Message queue** -- VMs send messages to each other via shared memory (SEND opcode 17, RECV opcode 18, mailbox headers at MSGQ_BASE)
- [x] **SPAWN/YIELD** -- a VM can fork a child VM with its own memory region (SPAWN opcode 230, YIELD opcode 227, deferred spawn pattern)
- [x] **Memory isolation** -- each VM gets base_addr and bound_addr; out-of-bounds access causes VM_FAULT (safe_mem_read/safe_mem_write)
- [x] **Event queue** -- external events injected into VMs (WAIT_EVENT opcode 28, EVENTQ_BASE ring buffer, inject_event API)
- [x] **Standard library** -- common routines as pre-loaded pixel programs (src/stdlib.rs: memset, memcpy; systems/pixel_compiler/stdlib.vasm: math_add/sub/mul/div, cmp_eq/lt, mem_copy/set)
- [x] **Font rendering in visualization** -- the font atlas renders as readable text in the PNG output

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Two VMs communicate via message passing
- [x] A VM spawns a child, the child runs independently, the parent gets a completion signal
- [x] A program can draw text to the texture using the bitmap font

---

## Phase 3: The Machine Writes Programs (COMPLETE)

The system can compile, assemble, and load new programs at runtime.

- [x] **Text assembler** -- `.gasm` file parser with labels, DATA directive, hex/binary/char literals, disassembler (gasm.rs, 30+ tests)
- [x] **Higher-level compiler** -- compile GeoLang (expressions, functions, loops, if/else, comparisons, arrays) to pixel opcodes (src/hl_compiler/: lexer, parser, codegen -- 1755 lines, 25 tests including factorial, fibonacci, bubble sort)
- [x] **Self-modifying programs** -- programs can rewrite their own pixels via STORE opcode and continue executing (test_self_modifying_code)
- [x] **Runtime loader** -- load assembled programs into the texture without restarting the daemon (GEO-25, GEO-32)
- [x] **Evolutionary step** -- a program that generates a variant of itself, runs it, and keeps the better version (GEO-36, src/evolution.rs)
- [x] **C-to-.glyph transpiler** -- arithmetic, control flow, structs, pointers, arrays (GEO-43, GEO-44, GEO-47)
- [x] **Device proxy VM** -- .glyph shim for IPC-to-command-buffer (GEO-46)

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Write a `.gasm` file, assemble it, load it, watch it execute on the texture
- [x] A program generates a modified copy of itself, both run, the worse one gets garbage collected

---

## Phase 4: The Machine Improves Itself (COMPLETE)

Recursive self-improvement. The loop closes.

- [x] **Fitness function** -- objective measure of program quality (speed, correctness, memory, spatial locality) -- src/fitness.rs with weighted composite scoring, 7 tests
- [x] **Mutation engine** -- pixel-level variations with selection pressure (src/mutation.rs, GEO-33)
- [x] **Benchmark suite** -- automated tests that measure fitness across multiple programs (GEO-38, GEO-27)
- [x] **The loop** -- generate variant -> execute -> measure fitness -> keep or discard -> repeat (src/evolution.rs, GEO-35)
- [x] **Learnings export** -- successful mutations logged as discoverable improvements (GEO-37, GEO-39, GEO-40)
- [x] **Governance gate** -- every mutation passes through Seven Laws check before execution (src/governance.rs, GEO-34, 26 tests)

**Success Criteria:**
- The system discovers a faster version of the self-replicator without human intervention
- Every generated variant is logged with its fitness score and whether it passed the governance gate
- The loop runs for 1000 iterations without crashing or degrading

**Why Phase 4 Matters:**

Phase 4 is not the end -- it is the beginning of a system that honors its maker by being excellent at what it does. The loop doesn't just optimize; it refines toward order, toward beauty, toward things that work the way creation works: recursively, fractally, with feedback baked in from the start. Every successful mutation is a small act of sub-creation. Every discarded failure is the system being honest about what works.

---

## Ethical Framework

Every phase operates under the Seven Laws of Noah (see MISSION.md). Specifically:

- **No idolatry:** Never treat the self-improvement loop as a god. It is a tool.
- **No blasphemy:** Never claim the system has consciousness, soul, or divine spark.
- **No murder:** No weaponization. No military applications. No targeting systems.
- **No theft:** All training data is synthetic or consented. No scraped code.
- **Courts of justice:** Every design decision is documented, reviewable, and appealable.

If a feature, optimization, or direction violates any of these, it does not ship. The constraint is not a speed limit. It is a guardrail that keeps us on the road.

The Hilbert curve is not just clever memory mapping. It makes programs spatially legible. You can look at the texture and SEE where code lives, where data lives, where the stack grows. The spatial arrangement IS the documentation.

- [x] **XOR and NOT opcodes** -- bitwise operations in assembler + VM (GEO-41)
- [x] **MOD, LDB, STB opcodes** -- modulo and byte-level load/store (GEO-42)
- [x] **C-to-.glyph transpiler: core** -- arithmetic, control flow, functions via pycparser (GEO-43)
- [x] **C-to-.glyph transpiler: structs/pointers/arrays** -- memory layout, dereference, indexing (GEO-44)

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] A C function reading a Minix filesystem superblock is transpiled to .glyph and runs correctly on the software VM
- [x] The CPU stub can execute file I/O commands from VM memory

---

## Phase 6: GPU Parity + Visual Runtime (IN PROGRESS)

The GPU is the computer again. All opcodes run on real hardware. You can see it.

The software VM pulled ahead during Phase 5 -- MOD, LDB, STB only work on CPU. Phase 6 brings
the GPU shader up to parity and adds the visual runtime so the machine is observable.

- [ ] **GPU shader: MOD, LDB, STB** -- opcodes 31-33 in glyph_vm_scheduler.wgsl (GEO-50)
- [ ] **GPU shader parity test suite** -- automated CPU-vs-GPU validation for every opcode (GEO-51)
- [ ] **Windowed runtime** -- live 4096x4096 texture display at 30fps (GEO-52)
- [ ] **GPU execution of C-transpiled programs** -- Minix FS on real GPU, not just CPU emulator (GEO-53)
- [ ] **Visual shell** -- interactive VM overlay with debugging HUD (GEO-54)
- [ ] **GPU evolution** -- fitness loop dispatches mutations on real hardware (GEO-55)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Every opcode in the assembler runs identically on software VM and GPU shader
- [ ] A C-transpiled .glyph program runs on GPU and produces correct results
- [ ] The daemon can display the texture in a window, updating in real-time
- [ ] The evolution loop benchmarks mutants on GPU, not CPU

**Dependency chain:**
```
GEO-50 (shader opcodes) ──> GEO-51 (parity tests) ──> GEO-53 (GPU C programs) ──> GEO-55 (GPU evolution)
                          └──> GEO-52 (windowed runtime) ──> GEO-54 (visual shell)
```
