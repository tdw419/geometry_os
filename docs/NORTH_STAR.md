# Geometry OS North Star

> **Superseded in part by [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) (2026-04-27).** The "make it more like Linux/Windows/macOS" framing in this document is no longer the goal — Geometry OS is pixel-native on a bare-metal RISC-V substrate, not a Linux-alike. The priority hierarchy and DO/DON'T rules below still hold; the old "Test" section has been removed. Read `SPEC.md` first.

## The One Rule

**Every change must make Geometry OS more capable or more alive.**

A real OS has: memory protection, a filesystem, proper scheduling, IPC, device abstraction, a shell, and programs that use all of it. A living OS also has rich visual programs that prove the VM can express complex, beautiful things.

## Priority Hierarchy

1. **Kernel features** (syscalls, memory protection, scheduling, IPC) -- this IS the OS
2. **Programs that prove kernel features work** -- a syscall without a program using it is vaporware
3. **Visual programs** (infinite terrain, weather, particles, animations) -- prove the VM is expressive
4. **Filesystem and persistence** -- programs need to store and load data
5. **Shell and user interface** -- the user needs to interact with the OS
6. **Standard library** -- raises the floor for all programs
7. **Assembler/VM quality-of-life** -- only when it unblocks something above

## DO

- Build the kernel boundary first, then memory protection, then filesystem, in that order
- Write a test program for every new syscall or opcode before moving on
- Keep existing programs working -- add a compatibility mode if kernel mode breaks them
- Make every commit leave `cargo test` green
- Document syscall conventions as you build them

## DON'T

- Add opcodes without a program that needs them
- Polish the visual debugger instead of building kernel features
- Spend a session on refactoring when there's kernel work to do
- Build speculative features ("wouldn't it be cool if...") -- build what the roadmap says
- Skip tests. Every new VM behavior gets a test.

## The Drift Risk

This project has 22 phases of VM construction behind it. The VM is fun to tinker with. New opcodes are easy to add. Visual polish is tempting. All of that is drift now. The goal is an OS, not a better VM. The VM serves the OS.
