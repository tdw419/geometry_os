## /superpowers (Core Workflows)

Enforces the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle and systematic debugging workflows. Prevents agents from claiming tasks complete until rigorous verification.

### Core Workflow Skills

| Command | Use When | Enforcement |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `brainstorming` | Starting new feature, need design exploration | Required before new features |
| `test-driven-development` | Implementing with tests first | Hard gate - deletes non-TDD code |
| `systematic-debugging` | Tests failing, need diagnosis | Soft gate - recommends workflow |
| `verification-before-completion` | Before claiming work is done | Hard gate - requires evidence |
| `executing-plans` | Have a written plan to execute | Soft gate |
| `writing-plans` | Need to create implementation plan | Soft gate |
| `receiving-code-review` | Got feedback to address | Soft gate |
| `requesting-code-review` | Need code reviewed | Soft gate |
| `dispatching-parallel-agents` | Have 2+ independent tasks | Soft gate |
| `finishing-a-development-branch` | Implementation complete, need to integrate | Soft gate |
| `subagent-driven-development` | Executing plans with independent tasks | Soft gate |
| `using-git-worktrees` | Starting feature work needing isolation | Soft gate |

### Superpowers Behavior

- **Hard Gates**: Skills that enforce mandatory behavior (e.g., TDD deletes code written before tests)
- **Soft Gates**: Skills that recommend but don't enforce
- **Required Invocation**: `brainstorming` MUST be called before any creative work

## Enforcement Levels Summary

| Level | Behavior | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Hard Gate** | Blocks progress until satisfied | TDD deletes non-tested code, verification requires evidence |
| **Soft Gate** | Recommends but doesn't block | debugging workflow, code review |
| **Required** | Must be invoked before related work | brainstorming before features |
| **Optional** | Can be used when helpful | Most utility commands |
