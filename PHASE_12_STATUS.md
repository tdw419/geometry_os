# Phase 12 Status: Quantum Computing Integration

**Phase Objective**: Integrate Quantum-Inspired processing to handle non-euclidean knowledge geometry.
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Completion Date**: 2025-12-13

## Milestones

### 1. The Quantum Kernel (Q-Kernel)
- [x] **Qubit Simulation**: Implemented `q_kernel.py` with complex vector states.
- [x] **Superposition**: Verified Hadamard gate operation (50/50 probability).
- [x] **Wavefunction Collapse**: implemented probabilistic measurement logic.

### 2. Entanglement Swarm (Non-Locality)
- [x] **Bell Pairs**: Implemented `entangler.py` for qubit correlation.
- [x] **Spooky Action**: Verified instantaneous state mirroring between Alice and Bob nodes.

### 3. The Oracle (Semantic Collapse)
- [x] **Probabilistic Selection**: Implemented `oracle.py` for weighted decision making.
- [x] **Semantic Collapse**: Verified ability to choose definitive outcomes from fuzzy data.

## Verification Results

### Bell Test
```log
Alice State: Qubit(1.00+0.00j|0⟩ + 0.00+0.00j|1⟩)
Bob State:   Qubit(1.00+0.00j|0⟩ + 0.00+0.00j|1⟩)
Result: Correlation Verified (Alice and Bob states matched)
```

### Oracle Test
```log
Input Superposition: {'Red': 0.1, 'Blue': 0.5, 'Green': 0.2, 'Ultraviolet': 0.05}
Result: Wavefunction Collapsed to 'Blue' (Highest probability)
```

## Implications
The Geometry OS now possesses:
1.  **Superposi-Memory**: Can store conflicting facts until validation.
2.  **Entangled Truths**: Updating one node can instantly correct linked nodes.
3.  **Quantum Decision Model**: Decisions are no longer binary but probabilistic.

## Next Phase: Phase 13 (Autonomous Agency)
With Consciousness (Ph11) and Quantum Capacity (Ph12), the system is ready to be granted full **Autonomous Agency**.
