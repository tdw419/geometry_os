# Progress: swarm-neb-integration

## Original Goal

Connect SwarmNode consensus system with NEBBus pub/sub for real-time, event-driven distributed decision-making. This creates a two-layer coordination system: real-time events (NEBBus) + durable storage (SwarmChannel).

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Create SwarmNEBBridge class with constructor

## Current Task

Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- TaskBoard pattern: optional `event_bus` param stored as `self._event_bus` (private)
- SwarmNEBBridge wraps SwarmNode, storing it as `self.node` for easy delegation
- TYPE_CHECKING import pattern used to avoid circular imports with NEBBus
- SwarmNode requires clipboard_url, optional node_id and threshold params

## Blockers

- None currently

## Next

Task 1.2: Implement create_proposal with NEB publishing
