# Progress: wordpress-git-coordination

## Original Goal

Multi-agent coordination system using WordPress as Track Board with file locking, branch-per-track enforcement, and visual pulse integration.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Create geometry-tracks.php plugin with track_claim CPT
- [x] 1.2 Add track handlers to ai-publisher.php

## Current Task

Task 1.3: Create TrackManager Python client

## Learnings

### Research Phase (2026-02-21)
- Existing WordPress plugins (Swarm Node, WebMCP) provide perfect REST API patterns
- Pre-commit hook already exists for WGSL checks - can chain track check after
- `ai-publisher.php` uses switch-case dispatcher - add track handlers there, not new REST routes
- Visual Bridge already has `wordpress_publish` handler - add `track_claim`/`track_release` following same pattern
- Git worktrees in use at `.worktrees/feat/` - branch-per-track already supported
- Conductor tracks.md format: `**[track-id](./path)**: description`
- Race condition mitigation: `get_posts()` + `wp_insert_post()` has ~50ms race window - acceptable for human-speed agents
- Quality commands: `make lint`, `make check`, `make test-unit`, `make test-integration`
- `geometry.agent-id` git config not set - install script should create it

## Blockers

- None currently

## Next

Complete research, then proceed to requirements

## Requirements Phase (2026-02-21)

### Learnings
- 5 user stories cover full ecosystem: agents, developers, end users
- P0 requirements: claim/release handlers, CPT registration, Python client, pre-commit hook
- P1 requirements: heartbeat expiry, Visual Bridge integration, git config setup
- Graceful degradation is critical: commits must succeed when WordPress unavailable
- 10-min heartbeat expiry balances stale claim cleanup with agent flexibility
- `strpos()` path prefix check is simpler and faster than regex for file overlap detection

### Decisions Made
- Claims stored as WordPress `track_claim` CPT (not custom table)
- Pre-commit hook chains after existing WGSL check (not replacement)
- Skip check via `SKIP_TRACK_CHECK=true` for emergency commits
- Visual Bridge handlers follow existing `wordpress_publish` pattern

## Design Phase (2026-02-21)

### Architecture Decisions
- Single Python client (`TrackManager`) handles both agent operations and git hook checks
- Exit code convention: 0=no conflict, 1=conflict, 2=WordPress unavailable (graceful)
- CPT admin columns: Track ID, Agent ID, Files Count, Heartbeat (with EXPIRED badge)
- WebSocket pulse format: `TRACK_CLAIMED`/`TRACK_RELEASED` with track_id, agent_id, coordinates

### Interface Patterns
- `ai-publisher.php`: Switch-case with `$action` and `$args` (same as existing handlers)
- `TrackManager`: Methods `claim()`, `release()`, `check_conflicts()`, `heartbeat()`, `list_active()`
- Visual Bridge: `elif msg_type == 'track_claim':` pattern (same as `wordpress_publish`)

### Technical Constraints
- 5s HTTP timeout for pre-commit hook (must not block developer)
- `strpos()` for path prefix overlap (O(n*m) acceptable for < 10 claims)
- Heartbeat stored in post meta as ISO datetime string
- Coordinates for pulse derived from hash of track_id (consistent per track)

### Unresolved
- Expired claim handling: mark as `trash` vs delete (recommend trash for audit)
- Coordinate derivation algorithm: hash vs lookup (recommend hash for simplicity)

## Tasks Phase (2026-02-21)

### Task Planning Learnings
- 20 tasks total across 5 phases (POC, Refactoring, Testing, Quality Gates, PR Lifecycle)
- POC phase focuses on claim/release cycle: CPT + handlers + TrackManager + CLI
- Visual Bridge integration deferred to Phase 2 (refactoring) to validate core first
- Pre-commit hook chains after existing WGSL check (lines 1-37 of current hook)
- Exit codes for CLI: 0=no conflict, 1=conflict, 2=WordPress unavailable (graceful)
- Tests use pytest with unittest.mock for HTTP mocking
- Quality commands: `python3 -m py_compile`, `python3 -m flake8`, `python3 -m pytest`

### Task Dependencies
- 1.2 (ai-publisher handlers) requires 1.1 (CPT registration) for query/insert
- 1.4 (CLI) requires 1.3 (TrackManager class) for implementation
- 2.4 (Visual Bridge) requires 1.2 (handlers) for trigger points
- 3.1 (unit tests) requires 1.3 (TrackManager) complete
- 4.1 (pre-commit) requires 1.4 (CLI) for invocation

### Risk Areas
- WordPress not running during verification - added graceful fallback
- Race condition on claim (~50ms window) - acceptable per design
- Test flakiness with WordPress integration - marked with skipif

## Implementation Phase (2026-02-21)

### Task 1.1 Complete
- Created `wordpress_zone/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/geometry-tracks.php`
- Registered `track_claim` CPT on `init` hook with clipboard menu icon
- Added admin columns: Agent ID, Files Count, Heartbeat, Status
- Added EXPIRED badge for heartbeat > 10 min (red text)
- Added dashboard widget for active claims overview
- Plugin requires manual activation in WordPress admin (or via WP-CLI)

### Learnings
- Plugin follows WordPress coding standards from `hello.php` example
- CPT is `public => false` but `show_ui => true` for admin-only access
- `current_time('timestamp')` returns local blog time for heartbeat comparison
- Dashboard widget shows top 10 recent claims with status indicators

### Task 1.2 Complete
- Added 4 switch cases to ai-publisher.php: claimTrack, releaseTrack, listTracks, heartbeatTrack
- Implemented `handle_claim_track()`: validates input, checks overlaps via strpos(), creates CPT, returns claim_id
- Implemented `handle_release_track()`: verifies agent_id owner, moves to trash (audit trail)
- Implemented `handle_list_tracks()`: queries active claims with heartbeat filter (10 min expiry)
- Implemented `handle_heartbeat_track()`: updates meta_heartbeat timestamp
- Added `notify_visual_bridge()` for non-blocking UDP notification to port 8769
- Added `check_file_overlaps()` helper using strpos() for path prefix matching
- All handlers verified with curl returning valid JSON

### Learnings
- PHP socket extension may not be available - graceful degradation with `function_exists('socket_create')` check
- WordPress already has test claim from previous POC testing
- 10-minute heartbeat filter uses DATETIME comparison in meta_query
