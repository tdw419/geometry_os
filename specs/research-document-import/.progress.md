# Progress: research-document-import

## Original Goal

Import 3,941 research documents from /home/jericho/zion/docs/research into WordPress as a custom post type for AI semantic search access.

## Interview Responses

### Requirements Interview
- Primary users: Both developers and end users (AI agents search, admins manage imports)
- Priority tradeoffs: Prioritize feature completeness (include admin UI, search enhancements, all features)
- Success criteria: Feature works as specified (all docs imported, AI can search them)
- Additional context: None

### Design Interview
- Architecture style: Extend existing architecture (fork sync_skills_to_wp.py, extend ai-publisher.php, add admin plugin)
- Technology constraints: No constraints
- Integration approach: Use existing APIs and interfaces (ai-publisher.php API, WordPress hooks)
- Additional context: None

### Tasks Interview
- Testing depth: Standard - unit + integration
- Deployment approach: Standard CI/CD pipeline
- Execution priority: Ship fast - POC first, polish later
- Additional context: None

## Current Task

Task 2.4: Implement admin UI page with import controls

## Learnings

### Task 2.3: Admin UI Plugin Skeleton
- Used `add_submenu_page('tools.php', ...)` to add page under Tools menu (not main menu)
- Plugin pattern from `claude-conversations.php`: class-based structure with constructor hooking to `admin_menu`
- `manage_options` capability required for admin access
- Plugin header comment required: Plugin Name, Description, Version, Author

### Task 2.2: searchResearch API Implementation
- WP_Query with 's' parameter provides full-text search on title and content
- Meta queries use array format with 'key', 'value', 'compare', 'type' for numeric comparisons
- 'relation' => 'AND' required when combining multiple meta_query conditions
- Response includes pagination: total (found_posts), limit, offset
- jq '.results | length' counts returned results for verification

### Task 2.1: Error Handling Implementation
- Added structured logging module with timestamps and log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Empty file handling: Check `os.path.getsize()` before reading to skip 0-byte files with warning
- Permission denied: Try/catch PermissionError with proper logging, continue processing
- Retry logic: `import_document_with_retry()` with max 2 retries, exponential backoff (1s, 2s)
- Timeout handling: DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=30s for normal files, LARGE_FILE_TIMEOUT=120s for 1MB+ files
- Server errors (5xx) retry, client errors (4xx) don't retry
- Connection errors get longer backoff (2s, 4s) than request errors (1s, 2s)

### General Notes
- **ARCHITECTURAL NOTE**: Task 1.1 specified adding CPT to `ai-publisher.php`, but `ai-publisher.php` is only loaded on direct API calls, not during WordPress init. Created separate plugin `research-document-cpt/research-document-cpt.php` to properly register CPT on init. Plugin activated successfully.
- Verify URL format: `http://localhost:8080/index.php?rest_route=/wp/v2/research_document` (not `/wp-json/` which returns 404)
- `sync_skills_to_wp.py` is the reference batch importer pattern - fork this for research docs
- `ai-publisher.php` has `updateArchitecture` action that updates by title - good for deduplication
- `WordPressMemoryProvider` already maps posts to Memory Beams zone (3000-3400, 1000-1400)
- Research docs: 3,982 files, 210K lines, mix of .txt/.md, some up to 1.7MB
- Import in 50-doc batches with 2s delay to prevent PHP timeout
- User priority: feature completeness over speed (include admin UI, search API)
- Success = all docs imported + AI can search them
- Filename pattern: `{number}_{topic}{iteration}.txt` - extract topic for title
- Design uses fork pattern: `import_research_docs.py` mirrors `sync_skills_to_wp.py` structure
- CPT registration in `ai-publisher.php` keeps single API endpoint - simpler than separate plugin
- Deduplication via `source_path` lookup + `file_hash` comparison for content change detection
- Admin UI plugin pattern from `claude-conversations.php`: nonce, transient, redirect with query args
- Memory Beams integration requires NO changes - `WordPressMemoryProvider.list_posts` already fetches all post types
- Import rate ~100 docs/min with 2s batch delay; full 4K docs ~40 minutes
- Task planning: 22 total tasks across 5 phases (POC, Refactoring, Testing, Quality Gates, PR Lifecycle)
- POC phase (5 tasks) validates core flow: CPT registration -> API action -> batch importer -> import 10 docs
- Refactoring phase (6 tasks) adds error handling, search API, admin UI with progress bar
- Testing phase (4 tasks) covers unit tests, mock tests, integration tests
- Quality commands: `python3 -m py_compile` for Python, `php -l` for PHP, `pytest` for tests
- Test pattern from `test_admin_ui.py`: mock PHP verification via grep/assertion on file contents
- `handle_import_research_document()` implements all 3 cases: created, updated, skipped based on source_path + file_hash
- API response includes `status` field for tracking import results in batch importer
- Title extraction regex: `r'^\d+_'` removes leading number, `r'\d+$'` removes trailing iteration, underscores replaced with spaces
- Python dataclass pattern from sync_skills_to_wp.py provides clean structure for document metadata
- POC checkpoint passed: 10 docs imported (5 created, 5 skipped), 12 total in WordPress
- Metadata fields verified: source_path, file_hash, line_count, import_batch all populated correctly
- Import batch ID format: `import_{timestamp}` allows tracking of import runs
- WordPress REST API may timeout on large responses; use ai-publisher.php API or direct DB queries for verification
- PHP server can hang if overloaded with wp-cron requests; restart if needed
