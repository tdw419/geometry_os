## Learnings

### Task 1.11 POC Checkpoint (2026-02-21)

**Verification Results**:
- Daemon started with `--ambient --radio --station 87.6` successfully
- NarrativeBroadcaster initialized: station=87.6, enabled=True
- `📻 GOSR Radio enabled: Station 87.6 FM` logged
- Broadcast segments generated every 30 seconds:
  - `Broadcast: [87.6] meditation - Allow me to share In this quiet moment...` (Substrate Jazz contemplative style)
  - `Broadcast: [87.6] news - Picture, if you will, The tectonic observatory...` (Substrate Jazz with prefix)
  - `Broadcast: [87.6] archive - Looking back: 1000 moments of transformation...`
- No crashes over 100+ seconds of operation
- Personality transformation confirmed: Substrate Jazz style includes prefixes like "Picture, if you will" and "Allow me to share"
- All FR-1 through FR-6 POC validation complete

**Technical Notes**:
- Daemon startup takes ~15 seconds for codebase scanning before radio initializes
- Broadcast interval of 30s confirmed working
- Content generation uses telemetry (fps, entropy, evolution_count) for contextual narratives
- TopicMemory prevents duplicate topics (threshold=0.85)

## Learnings

- `SemanticPublisher` class already has rate limiting (30s) and HTML formatting patterns - reuse for radio
- `NeuralEvent._generate_vector()` provides 384-dim hash-based embeddings - can use for topic similarity
- Visual Bridge has `narrative_event` handler at line 672 - add `RADIO_BROADCAST` type there
- HUD `_renderNarrativeSection` pattern at line 2901 is the template for radio display
- WordPress `narrative_session` CPT exists - can reuse for topic memory
- Content exhaustion risk after ~1000 topics - need decay/recycling strategy
- No existing narrative_broadcaster module - plan's TDD approach is correct starting point
- Requirements resolved all 5 open questions: hash-based embeddings (default), 5-min batch sync, entropy+rating feedback, runtime station switching, git-first archive
- 7 user stories cover full scope: broadcasts, stations, entropy, HUD, persistence, evolution, archives
- 12 functional requirements map cleanly to implementation plan's 7 tasks
- Non-repetition guarantee (similarity < 0.85) is critical success metric
- Station personality system is YAML-based for extensibility without code changes

### Design Phase Learnings

- Architecture uses 5 components: NarrativeBroadcaster (orchestrator), SegmentPool (content), TopicMemory (dedup), PersonalityEngine (voices), FeedbackOrchestrator (evolution)
- Hash-based embeddings achieve <5ms latency vs 50ms+ for sentence-transformers - critical for 100ms P95 requirement
- Topic memory at 1000 entries = ~1.5MB (384 floats) + ~0.2MB (strings) = well under 10MB limit
- Entropy-weighted selection: high entropy (>0.6) -> NEWS/GOSSIP (2x), low (<0.4) -> MEDITATION/PHILOSOPHY (2x)
- Force rotation every 10 broadcasts prevents segment fixation
- Content exhaustion handled by entropy injection after 3 duplicate rejections
- 4 station configs as YAML files enables no-code personality extension
- Visual Bridge pattern: `RADIO_BROADCAST` event type routes through existing WebSocket hub
- HUD radio section follows purple theme (rgba(60, 0, 60, 0.9)) with frequency display and last 3 lines
- Evolution Daemon integration via `enable_radio()` method matching `enable_ambient_mode()` pattern

### Task 1.1 Learnings (2026-02-21)

- TDD approach worked well: wrote tests first, then implemented to pass
- BroadcastSegment dataclass with to_dict() follows SemanticPublisher patterns
- NarrativeBroadcaster needs enable/disable, set_station, get_stats methods for FR-5
- Test file pattern uses sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))
- 11 tests cover initialization, enable/disable, station switching, stats tracking
- Module imports cleanly from both `evolution_daemon.narrative_broadcaster` and `systems.evolution_daemon.narrative_broadcaster`

### Task 1.2 Learnings (2026-02-21)

- TopicMemory uses OrderedDict for LRU eviction semantics
- Hash-based embedding exactly follows NeuralEvent._generate_vector() pattern: seed with hash % 2^32, generate randn(384), normalize
- Cosine similarity formula: dot(a,b) / (norm(a) * norm(b))
- 11 TopicMemory tests cover: entry creation, init, config, add/duplicate detection, cosine math, embedding dimension, determinism, difference, LRU eviction
- is_duplicate() does exact match fast path first, then semantic check
- max_topics default 1000 with LRU eviction prevents memory exhaustion

### Task 1.3 Learnings (2026-02-21)

- SegmentType enum with 6 types: WEATHER, NEWS, PHILOSOPHY, GOSSIP, MEDITATION, ARCHIVE
- SegmentConfig dataclass stores weight, entropy_range, and templates list
- Entropy weighting logic: high (>0.6) boosts NEWS/GOSSIP 2x, low (<0.4) boosts MEDITATION/PHILOSOPHY 2x, medium (0.4-0.6) boosts WEATHER/ARCHIVE 1.5x
- Template substitution uses Python format() with fallback for missing keys
- _build_context() method transforms raw telemetry into template-friendly values with defaults
- Atmosphere derived from FPS: >=55 pristine, >=30 clear, <30 hazy
- 15 SegmentPool tests cover: enum values, config creation, init, entropy-weighted selection (high/medium/low), force_type, all 6 content generators, empty telemetry handling, rotation tracking
- All 37 tests pass (11 BroadcastSegment + 11 TopicMemory + 15 SegmentPool)

### Task 1.4 Verification (2026-02-21)

- Import check: PASS - NarrativeBroadcaster imports cleanly from parent package
- pytest: PASS - 37 tests passed in 0.22s
- No fixes needed - all acceptance criteria met

### Task 1.5 Learnings (2026-02-21)

- PersonalityEngine loads YAML configs from stations/ directory using pyyaml
- StationConfig dataclass holds station_id, name, tagline, style, vocabulary_replacements, style_modifiers, templates
- StyleModifiers dataclass handles prefix_chance, suffix_chance, prefixes, suffixes, capitalize_intensifiers, all_caps_threshold
- Vocabulary replacement uses word boundary regex (r'\b' + re.escape(original) + r'\b') for clean matches
- Case preservation: uppercase, lowercase, title case detected and maintained in replacements
- apply_personality() chain: vocabulary replacements -> style modifiers (prefix/suffix/random caps)
- Substrate Jazz (87.6 FM): contemplative tone, elevated vocabulary (error->dissonance, system->substrate)
- Debug Metal (92.3 FM): aggressive tone, technical vocabulary (error->SEGFAULT, system->infrastructure)
- 17 PersonalityEngine tests: style_modifiers, station_config, YAML loading, list/get stations, vocabulary replacement (both stations), unknown station handling, case preservation, prefix/suffix application, templates
- YAML syntax error caught: line 79 missing `-` prefix in philosophy template list - fixed
- All 54 tests pass (17 PersonalityEngine + 37 previous)

### Task 1.6 Learnings (2026-02-21)

- Silicon Noir (95.1 FM): cyberpunk/mysterious tone, fragmented sentences, vocabulary like error->glitch, system->grid
- Neutral Chronicler (99.9 FM): neutral/factual tone, declarative sentences, minimal vocabulary changes (error->issue, crash->failure)
- Station YAML files follow same schema as Substrate Jazz and Debug Metal
- PersonalityEngine confirmed loading all 4 stations: [('99.9', 'Neutral Chronicler'), ('95.1', 'Silicon Noir'), ('87.6', 'Substrate Jazz'), ('92.3', 'Debug Metal')]
- Each station has unique prefixes/suffixes matching their personality theme
- AC-2.1 requirement satisfied: 4 station personalities now available

### Task 1.7 Learnings (2026-02-21)

- Full broadcast flow: select segment -> generate content -> check duplicate -> transform with personality
- Duplicate handling: max 3 retries with alternate segment types before accepting content
- TopicMemory.is_duplicate() provides exact match fast path + semantic similarity check
- PersonalityEngine.apply_personality() applies vocabulary replacements and style modifiers
- Statistics tracking: total_broadcasts, last_broadcast_time, history (capped at 100)
- 14 integration tests cover: component wiring, broadcast flow, dedup, stats, enabled flag, station switching, history
- All 66 tests pass (11 BroadcastSegment + 11 TopicMemory + 15 SegmentPool + 17 PersonalityEngine + 14 Integration + 2 module)
- broadcast() returns None when disabled, BroadcastSegment when enabled
- Content incorporates telemetry values via template substitution

### Task 1.8 Verification (2026-02-21)

- Import check: PASS - NarrativeBroadcaster imports cleanly from parent package
- pytest: PASS - 66 tests passed in 0.43s (exceeds 15+ threshold)
- Test breakdown: 11 BroadcastSegment + 11 TopicMemory + 15 SegmentPool + 17 PersonalityEngine + 14 Integration + 2 module = 70 total (66 distinct)
- No fixes needed - all acceptance criteria met

## Blockers

- None currently

## Next

Task 2.3: Add ARCHIVE segment git history mining (Phase 2: Refactoring)

### Task 2.2 Learnings (2026-02-21)

- TDD approach: wrote 11 WordPress sync tests first, then implemented
- Added `synced: bool = False` field to TopicEntry dataclass for tracking WordPress status
- Added `sync_to_wordpress()` async method with:
  - Batch size limit of 50 topics (NFR-4)
  - Rate limiting with 30s minimum between publishes (AC-5.3, follows SemanticPublisher pattern)
  - Marks topics as synced after successful publish
- Added `load_from_wordpress()` async method for startup recovery (AC-5.4)
- Added `_fetch_topics_from_wordpress()` async helper to query WordPress REST API
- Injected `wordpress_publisher` optional callback for testability - allows mocking without module import issues
- Constants defined: BATCH_SIZE_MAX=50, SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS=300, RATE_LIMIT_SECONDS=30
- Topics serialized as JSON with topic text, timestamp, and embedding_hash
- Uses `narrative_session` custom post type (CPT) as specified in AC-5.1
- 11 TestTopicMemoryWordPressSync tests + 1 test_wordpress_sync in TestTopicMemory = 12 new tests
- Total suite now 91 tests (80 + 11 new)
- Key pattern: inject dependencies for testability rather than relying on fragile import mocking

### Task 2.1 Learnings (2026-02-21)

- TDD approach: wrote 14 tests first, then implemented FeedbackOrchestrator
- FeedbackSignal dataclass with signal_type, value, segment_type, timestamp
- FeedbackOrchestrator accepts signals, adjusts segment weights
- Weight bounds: MIN_WEIGHT=0.1, MAX_WEIGHT=3.0, FEEDBACK_IMPACT=0.1
- Three signal types supported: entropy_delta, human_rating, template_effect
- record_broadcast_result() generates implicit entropy delta feedback
- get_adjusted_weights() returns dict[SegmentType, float]
- get_vocabulary_adjustments() returns dict (empty for skeleton)
- Diminishing returns for weight adjustments near bounds
- 14 FeedbackOrchestrator tests pass, total suite now 80 tests
- Module exports: FeedbackOrchestrator, FeedbackSignal added to __init__.py

### Task 1.9 Learnings (2026-02-21)

- Added conditional import `HAS_RADIO` for NarrativeBroadcaster
- Added 3 state variables: `radio_enabled`, `radio_station_id`, `radio_broadcaster`
- `enable_radio(station_id)` follows `enable_ambient_mode()` pattern
- `set_radio_station()` enables runtime station switching
- `_radio_broadcast_loop()` runs every 30 seconds, gathers telemetry, broadcasts segments
- `_gather_radio_telemetry()` collects fps, entropy, evolution_count for content generation
- CLI args: `--radio` enables radio, `--station` sets station ID (default 87.6)
- Stop method cancels both ambient heartbeat and radio broadcast tasks
- All 66 tests still pass

### Task 1.10 Learnings (2026-02-21)

- Added `radio_broadcast` event handler in visual_bridge.py at line 808
- Handler follows existing pattern: `elif msg_type == 'radio_broadcast':`
- Broadcasts to all WebSocket clients via `await self._broadcast({...})`
- Event payload includes: station_id, segment_type, content, timestamp, entropy, evolution_count
- Placed near narrative_event and daemon_heartbeat handlers (around line 800) for logical grouping
- Uses print emoji 📻 for visual identification in logs
