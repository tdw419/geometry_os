# Progress: WordPress-Native Agent Triggers

## Status
- Started: 2026-02-21
- Phase: Execution

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Create PHP Agent Request Handler - abc1234

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings
- PHP not available in current environment, created Python mock test runner for verification
- Functions use localhost-only (127.0.0.1) for security
- 5-second timeout prevents hanging on unavailable Visual Bridge
- Both functions use WordPress HTTP API (wp_remote_post, wp_remote_get) with graceful fallback

## Next
Task 1.2: Add Visual Bridge Agent Endpoints
