# Progress: The Motherboard

## Original Goal

Make the Infinite Map execute placed Resonance Glyphs - transforming the visual desktop into executable RAM.

## Interview Format
- Version: 1.0

## Intent Classification
- Type: GREENFIELD
- Confidence: high (5 keywords matched)
- Min questions: 5
- Max questions: 10
- Keywords matched: execute, glyphs, infinite, map, ram

## Interview Responses

### Goal Interview (from start.md)
- Problem: Adding new functionality - The Infinite Map currently displays glyphs but doesn't execute them
- Constraints: Must integrate with existing Resonance Glyph System and WebGPU shader
- Success criteria: Tests pass and glyphs execute on the map with visual feedback
- Additional context: Plan already exists at docs/plans/2026-02-26-the-motherboard-implementation.md

## Learnings

- Shader `visual_cpu_riscv_morph.wgsl` uses 46 registers per core (REGS_PER_CORE = 46u)
- CPU state layout: [0-31] = x0-x31, [32] = PC, [38] = CSR_HALT flag
- Holographic decode uses 2D Hadamard basis matching Python BASIS_MAP
- Symmetry validation checks quadrant mass distribution for geometric audit
- Glyph size is hardcoded to 16x16 pixels (GLYPH_SIZE = 16u)
- Max workgroup size is 64 in shader @workgroup_size(64)
- InfiniteMap already has PixelCPUIntegration pattern to follow for integration
- GlyphExecutor uses ES6 class syntax with dual export (module.exports for Node, window for browser)
- All placeholder methods log their invocation for debugging during POC phase
- WebGPU buffer sizes: systemMemory=1MB (1048576 bytes), cpuStates=64*46*4=11776 bytes
- Buffer usages: STORAGE | COPY_READ | COPY_WRITE for both buffers
- Atlas loading uses fetch() + createImageBitmap() + copyExternalImageToTexture() pattern
- Atlas texture format: rgba8unorm with TEXTURE_BINDING | COPY_DST | RENDER_ATTACHMENT usage
- atlasWidth/atlasHeight stored as instance properties after loading
- Glyph registry uses Map with key format `${x},${y}` for O(1) lookup
- GlyphEntry structure: { sprite, atlasX, atlasY, coreId, pc, active, lastResult, executionCount, glowIntensity }
- Core assignment uses round-robin modulo: coreId = registry.size % maxCores
- Duplicate registration at same position returns existing coreId without overwrite
- getActiveGlyphs() returns Array.from(registry.values()) for easy iteration
- execute() is async with executing flag to prevent re-entry
- syncCPUIStates creates Uint32Array, sets PC at baseIdx+32, atlas coords at baseIdx+0/+1
- dispatchCompute() is simulated for POC - increments glyph.executionCount
- readResults() checks halt flag at baseIdx+38 (simulated, always false for POC)
- updateVisualFeedback() updates sprite alpha/scale based on active/halted state
- glyphsPerRow = atlasWidth / 16 for calculating glyph index in atlas
- lastResult contains { executed, timestamp, results } after each execute() call
- InfiniteMap integration follows PixelCPUIntegration pattern: init in constructor after other integrations
- GlyphExecutor init is async (Promise chain), doesn't block constructor
- Ctrl+Enter keyboard shortcut added for glyph execution
- createGlyphSprite uses canvas-based rendering for POC (PixiJS v8 texture frame differs from v7)
- sprite.eventMode = 'static' is PixiJS v8 way to make sprites interactive
- Test page uses PixiJS v8 from CDN: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/pixi.js/8.0.0/pixi.min.js
- Dark theme: #0a0a0f background, #00ff88 accent color
- Glyph palette provides A, +, L, S, J, ∑ buttons mapped to ASCII codes 65, 43, 76, 83, 74, 8721
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Enter executes, 1-6 keys select glyphs
- PixiJS v8 uses app.init() async pattern instead of v7 constructor-only approach

## POC Verification (Task 1.8)

- GlyphExecutor exports correctly in Node.js environment
- test_motherboard.html structure verified: all scripts, elements, and PixiJS v8 CDN present
- Execution flow verified: registerGlyph -> execute -> glowIntensity updated
- Glow effect confirmed: glowIntensity = 0.37 after first execution (0.3 + 1 * 0.07)
- Visual feedback loop works: alpha/scale update based on execution count
- POC shortcuts: dispatchCompute simulated, no real WebGPU compute shader dispatch yet
