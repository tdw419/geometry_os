## Fix Task History
_No fix tasks yet._

## Learnings
- Phase 1: Created modular decoding system with separate classes for beam search and greedy decoding
- BeamSearchDecoder supports early stopping, length penalty, repetition penalty
- GreedyDecoder supports temperature sampling, top-k, top-p for more diverse generation
- Both decoders follow consistent API with decode() method returning (tokens, scores)
- Package includes factory functions and utility functions for easy decoder selection
- Phase 3: Compositor integration module created with simple API for real-time captioning
- Provides CompositorIntegrator class for advanced use cases and quick_caption() for simple usage
- Includes async frame captioning, batch processing, and caching support
- Examples demonstrate quick caption, integrator usage, batch processing, webcam, and file captioning
- Phase 4: Created comprehensive training module for custom dataset training
- ImageCaptionDataset supports text file (.txt) and JSON manifest caption formats
- Includes torchvision transforms with ImageNet normalization for image preprocessing
- CheckpointManager provides auto-save, best checkpoint tracking, and cleanup of old checkpoints
- Trainer class implements full training loop with validation, checkpointing, and progress logging
- All classes properly exported through training package for easy importing
