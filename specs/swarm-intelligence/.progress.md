# Progress: swarm-intelligence

## Original Goal

Build decentralized MapReduce-style swarm coordination with TaskBoard, SwarmAgent, and SwarmCoordinator

## Implementation Plan

Based on: `docs/plans/2026-02-22-swarm-intelligence-task-board.md`

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 Task data structure - verified 4 tests pass
- [x] 1.2 TaskBoard implementation - verified 7 tests pass

## Current Task

Ready to start Task 1.3: Reduction strategies

## Learnings

- Strategy pattern ideal for reduction strategies (extensible)
- flock critical for cross-process atomicity (not threading.Lock)
- File-based storage simplest for MVP (no database deps)
- Task lifecycle: PENDING->CLAIMED->IN_PROGRESS->COMPLETED/FAILED
- 4 task types mapped to 4 reduction strategies
- 32 total tests across 6 test files
- TaskBoard uses per-board lock file (.board.lock) for atomic ops
- parent_id stored in task.payload dict (not a direct field)

## Blockers

- None currently

## Next
