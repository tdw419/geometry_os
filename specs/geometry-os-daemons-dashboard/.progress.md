# Geometry OS Daemons Dashboard - Progress

## Original Goal
WordPress admin dashboard to monitor Geometry OS daemon processes with status, PID, uptime, CPU, and memory metrics.

## Plan Source
`docs/plans/2026-02-22-geometry-os-daemons-dashboard.md`

## Status
- Created: 2026-02-22
- Phase: tasks (artifacts generation)

## Completed Tasks
- [x] 1.1 Create main plugin file (geometry-os-daemons.php) - 2026-02-22

## Current Task
Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- Spec synthesis from detailed implementation plan completed 2026-02-22
- Existing `Daemon_Status` class in `ascii-desktop-control` provides proven pattern for pgrep-based process checking with transient caching
- Plugin follows same architecture as `ASCII_Desktop_Control` (class-based, hooks in constructor, separate includes)
- Daemons monitored: evolution_daemon.py, directive_daemon.py, visual_bridge.py
- Metrics added beyond original: CPU%, memory%, uptime formatting (not in Daemon_Status)
- Main plugin class uses singleton pattern with VERSION constant, plugin_dir and plugin_url properties
- AJAX handlers registered with wp_ajax_ hooks for daemon status, start, stop, restart operations
- Admin menu uses custom SVG hexagon icon for "Geometry OS" top-level menu

## Next
Task 1.2: Create Daemon_Monitor class
