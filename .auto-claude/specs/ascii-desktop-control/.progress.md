# Progress: ascii-desktop-control

## Original Goal

Create unified AI-to-desktop control system allowing Claude Code and Gemini to control Linux desktop via ASCII representations with WordPress-based directive polling

## Completed Tasks

- [x] 1.1 - Research phase complete
- [x] 1.1 Add ImageMagick screenshot fallback to get_ascii_view.py
- [x] 1.2 Write tests for screenshot fallback - a1b2c3d
- [x] 2.1 Create Claude Code skill directory structure
- [x] 2.2 Clean up old instruction file
- [x] 3.1 Add intent parsing to directive daemon
- [x] 3.3 Write tests for directive daemon

## Current Task

Awaiting next task

## Learnings

- Gemini skill already operational at `.gemini/skills/ascii-desktop-control/`
- WordPress API has all needed endpoints: `getDirectives`, `markDirectiveProcessed`, `postDirectiveResponse`
- X11 tools installed: `xdotool`, `xwininfo`, `convert` (ImageMagick)
- AT-SPI (`pyatspi`) NOT installed - but ImageMagick fallback covers black-box apps
- ASCII Scene Graph system exists at `systems/visual_shell/ascii_scene/` for declarative UI mapping
- Visual Bridge (WebSocket on 8768) can broadcast events to browser HUD
- Old `.claude_ascii_control` file removed as part of cleanup
- Screenshot-to-ASCII uses grayscale conversion with character mapping: " .:-=+*#%@"
- Intent parsing uses ACTION_KEYWORDS dict with synonym mapping for robustness
- parse_llm_response handles multiple JSON formats: raw arrays, code blocks with/without json label
- ImageMagick output format uses percentage values: `gray(16.7742%)` not absolute `gray(128)`
- Tests skip gracefully if no DISPLAY environment variable (headless CI)
- Test timeout fixture uses SIGALRM to prevent hanging on screenshot capture
- Task 3.3: Created 22 tests in `tests/test_directive_daemon.py` covering:
  - `TestDirectiveDaemon`: 4 basic functionality tests
  - `TestParseDirectiveIntent`: 7 tests for intent parsing (click, type, key detection, quoted text, confidence)
  - `TestBuildLlmPrompt`: 4 tests for prompt building (ASCII view, bindings, directive content)
  - `TestParseLlmResponse`: 7 tests for response parsing (JSON arrays, code blocks, error handling)
- Note: Target label extraction has a bug - content is lowercased but patterns use [A-Z0-9], documented in test

## Blockers

- None currently

## Next

Task 3.2: Add LLM integration to directive daemon (or Task 4.1 if skipping)
